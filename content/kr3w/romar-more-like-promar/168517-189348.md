    "description": "Yes, our very own Kevin Romar went pro last night. A surprise party was thrown for Kevin at the Red Room in Long Beach. Drinks were drank, Muska Dj'd, Kevin Fried Chicken (KFC!) shirts were distributed, and a Blind pro model board was presented to Romar. Needless to say, we're all very stoked. Congratulations Kevin.",
