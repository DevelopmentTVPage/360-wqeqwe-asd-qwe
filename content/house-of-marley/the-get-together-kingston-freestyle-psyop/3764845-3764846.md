We centered on two locations: Kingston, Jamaica and New York City, and shot two videos in each city. The idea was simple: How one speaker can bring everything together - friends, cities, even style eras.\n\nRocksteady & Freestyle. New Jack & Riddim. Mods & Rockers.\nMusic connects us all.\n_____________________\n\nPsy-Op Production Credits:\n\nLydia Holness - Executive Producer\nRyan Mack - Producer\nNick Read - Producer\nGerald Ding - Psy-Op Creative Director\nNile Saulter - Director of Photography\nEddie Grams - Second DP\nCass Vanini - Editor\nHye Sung Park - Art Director\nJamal Otolorin - Lead Animator\nJeffrey Lai - Animator\nHyun Song - Animator\nMaxim Kornev - Compositor\nRon Sudul - Colorist, Nice Shoes",
