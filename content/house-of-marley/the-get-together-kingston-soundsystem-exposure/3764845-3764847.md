We centered on two locations: Kingston, Jamaica and New York City, and shot two videos in each city. The idea was simple: How one speaker can bring everything together - friends, cities, even style eras.\n\nRocksteady & Freestyle. New Jack & Riddim. Mods & Rockers.\nMusic connects us all.\n_______________________\n\nExposure Production Credits:\n\nDirector: Wonford St.James\nDP: Irwin Matutina \nEditor: Clark Cramer\nProducer: Michelle Serieux",
