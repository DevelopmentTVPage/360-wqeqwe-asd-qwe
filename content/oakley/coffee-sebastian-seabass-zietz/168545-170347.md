    "description": "During his time off from a busy competitive schedule, Sebastian \"Seabass\" Zietz spent his offseason the best way he knows how: staying in the water all day long. Enjoying the winter season in Hawaii and squeezing in a quick trip to Tahiti (along with a few waves sprinkled in from Europe and Bali earlier in the year), Seabass has been on the move, perfecting his craft. The three-thumbed Kauaian is looking sharp and explosive for the beginning of the 2014 Samsung Galaxy World Championship Tour, which kicks off next week on the Gold Coast in Australia.\n\nSong: \"Breakneck Speed\" by Tokyo Police Club",
