    "description": "The Coda has a standard-width mountain-twin shape and medium flex; a big mountain rocker design for more aggressive riders who charge both in and out of bounds: technical steeps, big drops, advanced sidecountry, tight trees, bottomless powder, backcountry kickers; all with a new shape developed to manage real mountain snow with critical float and speed.",
