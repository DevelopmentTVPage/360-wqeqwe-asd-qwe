    "description": "East Coast team rider Ed Garner recently flew out to California to shoot for his new edit. We felt the footage was so good that it was necessary to share a pure Raw Run before the edit release. Watch Ed navigate all the pavement changes on this gnarly road in the hills of Central California, and stay tuned for the new edit coming out next week!\nTeam Rider: Ed Garner\nFollow Cam: Tom Flinchbaugh\nEdit: Nate Shute\nTo learn more about Arbor Skateboards visit: arborcollective.com\/skateboards",
