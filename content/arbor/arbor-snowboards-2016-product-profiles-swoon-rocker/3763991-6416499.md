    "description": "A women\u2019s specific all-mountain snowboard, the Swoon is built on a mountain-twin shape with a medium flex. Responsive pop and powerful edge control make the Swoon the perfect board for women who don\u2019t let ski area boundaries limit their riding. More responsive than the Cadence, The Swoon offers increased stability at higher speeds for the more advanced rider. We have expanded the Swoon offering to include both System Rocker and System Camber versions.",
