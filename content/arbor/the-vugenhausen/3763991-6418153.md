    "description": "The Vugenhausen is a team designed board built for fast freeriding. It offers superior traction and leverage over your trucks for race day performance while a stiff, symmetrical platform gives you the same feel no matter what direction you're going, and gas pedals contribute to superior turn and drift control. A micro-drop and rocker through the platform of the board create contours to keep your feet where they're meant to be.\nL: 37.00\"\nW: 9.75\"\nWB: 28\"-29\"\nThe 2013 Vugenhausen features a Hawaiian Koa bottom sheet with art by Eric Waetzig.\nRiders: James Kelly and Tyler Howell\nCheck out the Vugenhausen here - arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/426741\/vgenhausen\nCheck out Arbor Skateboards everywhere:\narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
