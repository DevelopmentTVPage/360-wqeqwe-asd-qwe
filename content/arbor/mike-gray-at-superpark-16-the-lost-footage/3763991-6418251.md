    "description": "Arbor Snowboards regional team rider, Mike Gray threw down at Snowboarder Magazine's Superpark 16 last May and the footage was never released. In anticipation of Superpark 17 kicking off, we decided it was time for this lost footage to hit the internet. Get pumped, the Arbor team is about to lay siege to Mount Bachelor, Oregon again this May for Superpark 17!",
