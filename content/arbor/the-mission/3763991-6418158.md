    "description": "The mission is a mid-sized surf inspired swallowtail cruiser with an extended concave profile and a long wheelbase that make it ideal for cruising, carving banks, and mellow downhill. The true kicktail means no pile of dog poo, garden hose, or sleeping hobo stand in the way of your urban traverse, you can pop right over them. Take to the streets and turn your commute into a Mission.\n\nL: 37.00\"\nW: 8.875\"\nWB: 23.00\"\n\nThe Mission comes in a Griptape topsheet with art by Zach Johnsen, or a Walnut topsheet with art by Matt Smith.\n\nCheck the Mission out here:\narborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/426740\/mission-gt\narborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/426739\/mission-walnut\n\nCheck out Arbor Skateboards everywhere:\narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
