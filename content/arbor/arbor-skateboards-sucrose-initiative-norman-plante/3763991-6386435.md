    "description": "Norman Plante carries one of the most recognizable styles with him everywhere he goes, whether it\u2019s the East Coast or the West Coast, and we filmed this with Norm before he headed back home to hibernate for the rest of winter. Norm knows that our Sucrose Formula in the 69mm Vice and 71mm Summit won\u2019t let him down whether it\u2019s at 50mph or 25mph, on perfect pavement or on chunder.\nThe Sucrose Initiative was developed to bring rider-based design and quality material driven performance together to deliver a product that is friendly to the earth and your wallet.\n\nFilm\/Edit: Alex Ameen\n\nOther Episodes:\nSam Hay\nDaniel Macdonald",
