    "description": "In the second episode of Getting Lost With Ian Sams, Ian and Erik Leon wonder through the Midwest and miles of open highway and little towns all the way to Michigan where they meet up with Austin Young aka Young Pissa. And then the struggles begins...they were kicked out of more spots than they thought possible and battled the rails they had time with but in the end, they had a good time and bring us a humorous new episode filled with slams, laps and mont du loc. Enjoy.",
