Ranging from classic squared off tails and shoveled noses, the series encompasses everything that makes skateboarding fun and creative. The Legacy series is available in 3 shapes\/sizes and all were designed to maintain 100% skate functionality to meet all the requirements of today's street skater.\nAs always, the Whiskey Project features our Grassroots Construction - a renewable bamboo top ply to deliver more pop, lighter weight, and increased durability.\nCheck out the whole lineup of Arbor Skateboards at: arborcollective.com\/skateboards\/products\/\nRiders: Sean Imes and Kyle Smith\nFilm: Jack Boston and Jordan Tabayoyon\nEdit: Jack Boston",
