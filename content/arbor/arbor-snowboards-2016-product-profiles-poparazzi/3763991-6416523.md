    "description": "If you\u2019re not looking for the spotlight, you better steer clear of the Poparazzi because you\u2019re gonna be bagging cover shots in no time after stepping foot on this board. The Poparazzi is a medium to soft flex, women\u2019s specific rocker snowboard designed to take you anywhere on the mountain without taking a toll on your wallet. Parabolic reverse camber and Grip Tech make this board exceptionally easy to ride so that you can focus on improving the techniques that will allow you to progress to the next level.",
