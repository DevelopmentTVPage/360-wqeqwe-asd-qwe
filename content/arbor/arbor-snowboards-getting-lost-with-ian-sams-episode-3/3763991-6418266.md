    "description": "In this episode 3 of Getting Lost With Ian Sams, the crew heads to Japan with the Flux Bindings team and well, they can't help but get lost in the streets, the powder and of every weird store, bar and restaurant along the way. Erik Leon once again joins Ian Sams making for a nice mix of debauchery and style between the two riders. This episode brings you parks and powder and next up from Japan in episode 4, we'll see what happened in the streets.",
