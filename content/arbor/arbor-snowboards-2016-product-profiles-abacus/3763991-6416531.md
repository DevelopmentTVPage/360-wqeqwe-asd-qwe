    "description": "The Abacus is designed with the end goal of accessing and riding the widest range of backcountry terrain possible. A reclined version of our System Rocker technology has been implemented in the build of the Abacus to increase skin to snow contact when climbing, without sacrificing float in deeper snow. This highly adaptable split has won multiple awards including Backcountry Magazine\u2019s Editor\u2019s Choice Award and Splitboard Magazine\u2019s Most Versatile Award.",
