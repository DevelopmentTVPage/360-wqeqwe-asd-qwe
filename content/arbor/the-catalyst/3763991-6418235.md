This supremely balanced twin-tip features a light lay-up and wide kick-tails for easy trickability and maximum control. A dialed in flex gives you power in an out of carves but won't bottom out on drops. Two sizes, at 38 and 42 inches, allow you size your board based on style and terrain.\nL: 38.00\" \/\/ 42.00\"\nW: 9.00\" \/\/ 9.25\"\nWB: 28.00\" \/\/ 32.00\"\nArt by Max Neutra\nCheck out the Catalyst here: arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/icon-freestyle\nRider: Adam Crigler\nCheck out Arbor Skateboards everywhere:\narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
