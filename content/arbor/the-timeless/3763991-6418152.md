The wide concave and substantial wheelbase give you maximum push and speed stability, while remaining lively enough for hard carving and expression sessions.\nL: 46.00\"\nW: 9.50\"\nWB: 32.25\"\n\nThe Timeless comes in 4 topsheet options: Hawaiian Koa, Bamboo, Walnut, and Griptape with art by a handful of artists.\nKoa: Ryan Jacobs \nBamboo: Nanami Cowdroy \nWalnut: Justin Kious \nGriptape: Zach Johnsen\n\nCheck out Arbor Skateboards everywhere:\narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
