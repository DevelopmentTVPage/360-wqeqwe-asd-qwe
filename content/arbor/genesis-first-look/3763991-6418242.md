    "description": "The Genesis is our top of the line cruiser board, with added features for freestyle performance.\n\nThe Genesis is a drop-through board, bringing you closer to the ground for ease of pushing and sliding. The fiberglass reinforced flex provides a solid ride on a wider and more functional platform that gives you enough room to walk tail to nose and back again. New concave for 2013 means more lock in, and angled kick-tails with the width to nail any trick you want.\n\nThe Genesis comes in at 38 or 44 inches. Choose a size to suit your style.\nRider: Will Clay\n\nGenesis 38- L: 38.00\" W: 9.25\" WB 26.00\"\nGenesis 44: L: 38.00\" W: 9.60\" WB: 32.00\"\n\nThe 2013 Backlash features a Hawaiian Koa topsheet.",
