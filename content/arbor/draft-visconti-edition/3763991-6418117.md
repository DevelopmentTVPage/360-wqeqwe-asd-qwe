    "description": "The Draft Visconti has a standard-width, true-twin shape and soft flex. Nick Visconti wanted to bring a level rustic style to his board this year, tuning it to how he views the experience. The Draft Visconti Edition is a jib-specific rocker board for riders whose focus is all-around street inspired freestyle - rails, boxes, stumps, wall rides, spinning, pressing, and butters.",
