    "description": "You might think that growing up on an island smaller than most cities would limit you, especially being surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, but Kyle Smith has managed to transform the island of Oahu into his own skateboard haven.\n \nDestroying rails and ledges while leaving crushed coping in his wake, Kyle embodies a style and creativity that could only be homegrown on the islands and has found a home on Arbor\u2019s Whiskey Project.\n \nKeep an eye out for Kyle and the rest of the Whiskey Team this year.\n \nWelcome to Arbor Skateboards Kyle.",
