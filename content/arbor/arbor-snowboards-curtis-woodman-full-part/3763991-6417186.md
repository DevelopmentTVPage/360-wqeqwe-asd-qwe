    "description": "Curtis Woodman is an individual to the fullest extent. It\u2019s difficult to define Curtis as both his snowboarding and personality fall outside of any societal preconceptions or stereotypes. He picks his own line down the mountain and hides in the white room most of the winter. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to get a glimpse into the mind of Curtis through his Surf The Earth video series over the past few months. And now, without further ado, Curtis presents the culmination of all his hard work from last season in his Surf The Earth \u2013 Full Part.\nOther Episodes:\nSeason 2\nTahoe\nWashington\/Tahoe\nMontana\/Utah\/Washington\nWyoming\nCurtis Woodman - Full Part\nSeason 1\nEpisode 3\nEpisode 2\nEpisode 1\nTo Learn more about Arbor Snowboards visit:\narborcollective.com\/snowboards\/",
