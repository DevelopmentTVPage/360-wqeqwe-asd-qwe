    "description": "Ian Sams is always somewhere. Somewhere is anywhere really... In his head, rolling up, and dropping in all qualify. We generally see him crushing it in Bear Mountain's Sunday In The Park episodes, but this year, Sams is lost. We took him out of his element and on the road with friends to film for a full length video part dropping Fall 2013. In this episode, Erik Leon joins the crew for a week of Montana mayhem and shredding in the middle of nowhere. Let it roll!\nDirected\/Filmed\/Edited By: Eli Weiner",
