    "title": "Arbor Skateboards :: Ed Garner",
    "description": "From Maryland, and residing in Pennsylvania, Ed is known as a top freerider on the East Coast. He joined the Arbor team only a few months ago, and is already proving to be a huge part of the family. In his first edit with Arbor skateboards, we took him up to the rural zones of Central California and allowed him to have the ability to show off his style and sketchiness.\nWatch and see how the beauty of a California Spring is paired with the some of the gnarliest road conditions you can find. Ed has to navigate through 5 different pavements, mixed with rocks, gravel, and pot holes. Many people would call this road unskateable, but amazingly Ed proves otherwise.\nTo learn more about Arbor Skateboards visit: arborcollective.com\/skateboards",
