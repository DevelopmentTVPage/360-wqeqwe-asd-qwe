    "description": "The Prodigy is a micro-drop speed board designed to perform on race day or during a freeride session.\n\nThis design has 1\/4\" of drop, executed over a very small length, which keeps your feet closer to the trucks than any other drop deck, meaning you sacrifice minimal grip or leverage. 5\/8\" of rocker through the platform works well on the feet and creates ideal standing surfaces for powerslides as well as tuck position. A mellow w-cave runs through the center, creating a channel to rest your back foot in during tuck, and an extra leverage point on the inside of your front foot. All these features allow you to take turns without leaving your tuck, meaning you keep critical levels of speed.\n\nL: 38.00\"\nW: 9.85\"\nWB: 30.00-30.50\"\n\nThe 2013 Backlash features a Hawaiian Koa bottom sheet and art by Eric Waetzig.\n\nRider: Max Myers",
