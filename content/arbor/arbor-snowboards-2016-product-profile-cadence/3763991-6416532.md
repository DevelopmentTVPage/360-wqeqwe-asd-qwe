    "description": "We know it\u2019s all about finding your rhythm on the mountain and that\u2019s why we created the Cadence. This freestyle-oriented, women\u2019s specific snowboard has a softer flex that makes turning effortless and learning tricks easy like Sunday morning. The Cadence is geared towards freestyle riding but doesn\u2019t take kindly to labels. Bring the Cadence in any terrain and you will see, first-hand, that this board can hold its own across a wide range of conditions and variables.",
