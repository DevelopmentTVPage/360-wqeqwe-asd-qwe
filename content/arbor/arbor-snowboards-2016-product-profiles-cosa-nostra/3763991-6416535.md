    "description": "20 years ago, we pioneered the wood-topped snowboard and ever since, we\u2019ve paired this aesthetic with an environmentally conscious approach to snowboard production. The Cosa Nostra packs these foundational characteristics and core values into a premium gun shaped plank for the powder sensei. We combine our love for the white room with our love for the environment by building every Cosa Nostra with a unique, reclaimed wood top-sheet using trimmings left over from years of production runs.",
