    "description": "The Zygote Twin is a non-symmetrical twin, a fusion of true-twin on-snow geometry with distinct tip and tail outlines that pay homage to the shaping and art traditions of early skate and snow design. While dissimilar in shape, the tip and tail share identical widths, heights and lengths, creating a symmetrical twin ride designed for true-cambered, freestyle snowboarding.",
