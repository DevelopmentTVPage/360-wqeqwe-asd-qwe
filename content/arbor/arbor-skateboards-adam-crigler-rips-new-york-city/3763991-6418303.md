    "description": "Arbor Skateboards rider, Adam Crigler is the Boss! The longboarding boss of New York City. He knows how to tear the \"Big Apple\" a new one. Here he rips his new Arbor Catalyst 42 all over town and in Central Park ducking around big crowds of people, surprise thunder storms, mad cabbies, and potholes that appear from underneath a maze of moving traffic. Giving it up to the New York City boy.\n\nSong:Atlas\nArtist:Dpat\n\nFilming & Editing By: Olivier S\u00e9guin-Leduc \nAdditional Filming: Max Myers\nCheck out Arbor everywhere:\narborcollective.com",
