    "description": "The Whiskey is a traditionally shaped skateboard aimed at skating ledges, rails, parks, or any other feature you can find. It features our tried and true maple and bamboo blend for extra pop and add durability. The Bamboo top sheet helps deter snapping and keeps your board from chipping when it takes hard impacts on the nose and tail. The Whiskey comes in 4 widths, 7.75\", 8.0\", 8.25\", and 8.5\"\nThe 7.75 and 8.0 versions are 32 inches long with 14 inch wheelbases.\nThe 8.25 and 8.5 versions are 32.5 inches long with 14.5 inch wheelbases.\nThere are two series -- the Limited Edition features art by Sylvia Ji, and the Team Edition features art by Eric Waetzig.\nCheck out the Whiskey here:\narborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/icon-whiskey\narborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/icon-whiskey-limited\nCheck out Arbor Skateboards everywhere:\narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
