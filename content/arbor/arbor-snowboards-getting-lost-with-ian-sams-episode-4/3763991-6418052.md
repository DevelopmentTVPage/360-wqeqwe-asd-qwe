    "description": "Still lost in Japan, Ian Sams and Erik Leon connect with Yuma Abe and head to Ishiuchi Resort for a quick and dirty park session in between filming a couple of street spots. The boys stacked some clips for their full parts and had a blast taking in the unique culture of Japan. As can be expected with this crew, things got a pretty weird and sometimes out of hand along the way.",
