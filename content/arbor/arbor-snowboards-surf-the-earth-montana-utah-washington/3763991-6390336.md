    "description": "Last season, Lake Tahoe kicked off the winter with mediocre snowfall which meant insufficient time in the white room for our boy, Curtis Woodman. An insatiable hunger for tasty barrels and higher tides drove Curtis to chase the storms in search of whiter pastures. His journey took him to Montana, Utah, and Washington where he met up with fellow earth surfers Colin Langlois, Chris Rasman, Shaun McKay, Pat McCarthy, Nick Ennen, Kurt Jensen, and even the infamous Coonman.",
