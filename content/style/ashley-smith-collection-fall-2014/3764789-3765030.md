    "description": "Introducing the first RVCA x Ashley Smith signature collection for Fall 2014.\n\"I believe there are things in everyone's closet that they can't live without, things essential to their personal style. My first capsule collection with RVCA exemplifies my own essentials. My style is inspired by a Balance of Opposites: My childhood, growing up with a punk influence with multi-colored hair and living in band t-shirts, to now, being a model living in NYC and traveling the world on fashion shoots. This collection reflects this clash of urban street with a vintage twist, mixing an edgy leather jacket with a blush tone sweater knit dress, or a sweet daisy-printed chiffon blouse with high-waisted leather shorts. My friend, photographer Sandy Kim, and I collaborated on the following imagery to showcase how opposing styles can make these essentials work. No matter what you like or where you come from, wether you're feeling like a good girl or a bad girl, these pieces are meant to make you feel 100% rad and 100% you!\" - Ashley Smith\nVideo by Brandon Jensen, styled by Miyako Bellizzi, Music: What me Worry by the Cosmonauts courtesy of Burger Records",
