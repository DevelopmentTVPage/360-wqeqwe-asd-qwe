    "description": "Highlights from the second stop Arnette's 2012 Cash Pot Surf Series at Blackies, Newport Beach.. With the help of Transworld SURF, the event went down in 1-3 foot waves as stacked heats of surfers came from all over Ventura County, San Diego County and Orange County to paddle out for their chance to win a piece of the $3,000 up for grabs.\n\nWaves were shredded, good times were had and cash was handed out to the winners of each heat, as well as the top guys in the finals.\n\nJason Harris took first in the Pro-Am division and Austin Ortiz earned top honors in the juniors.\n\nFuture 2012 Arnette Cash Post Surf Series dates and locations include:\n* 3\/17 -- Ventura, Los Angeles, CA\n* 4\/21-22 (two day waiting period) -- Casino Pier, Seaside Heights, NJ\n* 7\/08 -- Kewalo Basin, Honolulu, HI\n* 7\/14 -- Steamer Lane, Santa Cruz, CA\n* 8\/13 -- Ponce Inlet, FL\n* 8\/17 --Outerbanks, NC\n\nLimited space is available at each event in the Cash Spot Surf Series, given out on a first come, first serve basis.
