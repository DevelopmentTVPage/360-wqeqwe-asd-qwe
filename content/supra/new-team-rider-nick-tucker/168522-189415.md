    "description": "Nick was invited as a guest on the Three Amigos tour last year and he's been impressing the team ever since. So much so that he earned himself a spot on the SUPRA roster.\n\n\"It's truly an honor to be a part of SUPRA and grow with the whole team and the brand,\" Nick said. \"I couldn't be more proud to lace up a pair of SUPRAs every morning. And it's a great feeling knowing I'm repping the best shoes in the game.\" \n\nThe newest SUPRA team rider is wearing the newest SUPRA team shoe for this switch f\/s feeble: the black suede and black canvas Pistol low top. \n\nSUPRA looks forward to a long and productive relationship with Nick Tucker. The Pistol low top is available at better skate retailers and suprafootwear.com.",
