I like it. Hell yeah, man.\"\n\nDadd customized his signature Shotgun with replica reptile leather, purple nylon and black suede. Leather and suede are applied at key contact areas of all Shotgun models to protect against wear, while nylon or canvas allow for ventilation, and a padded mesh interior ensures optimum comfort.The scalloped collar and ribbed heel supply padding and ankle support, while the vulcanized sole provides excellent board feel and superior traction. \n\nThe Shotgun is available now in three new color profiles\u2014black suede and canvas, black and grey suede, and Keelan Dadd's signature color way\u2014at better skate retailers worldwide.",
