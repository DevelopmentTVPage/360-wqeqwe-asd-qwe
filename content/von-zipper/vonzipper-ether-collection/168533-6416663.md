    "title": "VonZipper : Ether Collection",
    "description": "The ether collection by VonZipper is a full frontal assault on frames being technical without losing design creativity and edge. Here's where the rubber hits the road. If you wanna rip, have lots of grip, with no slip, our RGNS system features rubber nose pads and temple tips. These lightweight frames with pop-n-lock hinges simplify the construction and make them more flexible and durable, so you can compete without looking or being beat. Burn your training bra and toss your jockstrap out the window.",
