    "description": "Irvine, CA, January 30, 2015 \u2013 Halldor Helgason never played varsity basketball. He also never won Homecoming King. But as the snowboarding world knows, he is the one getting the last laugh, which is exactly why VonZipper is proud to welcome him to the team.\n\nWith big wins like X Games Big Air Gold and the 2014 Transworld Snowboarding\u2019s Readers Choice Rider of the Year, it\u2019s no wonder why VZ and the snowboard community have awarded him with the \u201cMost Likely to Succeed\u201d superlative. So while all the other jocks from high school are still rocking their letterman jackets, Halldor will be walking through the halls with a cheerleader on each arm and a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cYah, it\u2019s cool man,\u201d exclaims foreign exchange student Halldor Helgason.\n\n\"We definitely feel that Halldor has always been a star student, even if he\u2019s had a few unexcused absences. Just like VonZipper, he has always stood up for the Geeks and Freaks,\u201d says VZ Winter Activities teacher Stephen Duke.\n\nDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover and keep an eye on Halldor and the rest of the VonZipper snow team, because they will prove to be the coolest kids from class.",
