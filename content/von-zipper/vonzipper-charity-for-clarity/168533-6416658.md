    "description": "Knowing that seeing is believing and we believe in seeing,Vonzipper will donate one optical frame for every optical frame we sell. With a simple purchase of a frame, a life is changed forever, and that's a real eye-opener.\n\nThroughout the world, the cost of eyeglasses is far beyond the reach of the needy. In many developing nations the cost of a frame can be the equivalent to one year's salary. Without assistance, thousands of people go without the glasses that they need to read, work, attend school and do the everyday activities that we take for granted.\n\nThe Retina Revolutionaries from VonZipper are here to fight for the right of sight, as it is our mission to bring the vision! We feel that it is important to share our success and hope that you will share our focus. So join us in giving something back and become a Pupillary Missionary!",
