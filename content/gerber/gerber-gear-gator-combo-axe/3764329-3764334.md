    "description": "Axes have been around for ages. And even our award-winning axes are hardly new. But the Gator Axe is a wood-bustin' breakthrough. Because we applied our proprietary Gator textured rubber to the grip for an unprecedented level of comfort and control. Beneath that tactile rubber surface is a virtually indestructible glass-filled nylon handle. And inside that handle is a hollow area containing a magnet that can hold a knife. The axe head is engineered from forged steel, which does an outstanding job of keeping its edge.",
