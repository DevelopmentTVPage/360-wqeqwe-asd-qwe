    "description": "This week we headed out to the motocross playground known as beaumont and ripped around on the sportster. Tons of great hill climbs, berms, and jumps everywhere here. We make videos like this to show you what is capable on your harley with minor adjustments on them. Build a bike that will take any beating and will be ready for more.\n\n\nFilmed \/\/ Directed by @Garrett.Riker",
