    "title": "Rusty Butcher : Mama Tried Recap",
    "description": "The boys and I loaded up the van with 4 sportsters and a brand new Street 750 built into a flat track racing machine and they drove 2000 miles to Milwaukee  to be apart of one of the funnest shows I have ever been to! Friday was a jam packed sold out arena of 8000 people to watch some crazy Hooligan Racing! Rusty Butcher and Harley Davidson killed it out there and I ended up 2nd place out of 30 riders. (Was just shy of 1st place AMA pro Benny Carlson) Saturday we woke up early and headed to the show venue to what it looked like thousands of people lined up to get into the show as well. We met so many killer people and want to thank everyone for purchasing or coming by the booth! Sunday we ended up driving 100 miles out with the frozen few dudes (who are fucking rad as hell) and found a frozen lake and shredded our asses off. Wheelies, racing, ice, old & new HD bikes.. Doesn't get any better than that! See you next year Mama Tried!",
