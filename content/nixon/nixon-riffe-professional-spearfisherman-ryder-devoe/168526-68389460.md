    "description": "To celebrate our new Riffe Digi-Tek Camo Collection, we went exploring around San Clemente Island off the coast of California with spear-fisherman Ryder DeVoe. Sitting 56 miles off the San Diego coast with limited access under its status as a military test site, San Clemente Island has some of the most diverse and untouched terrain in Southern California. Exploring the picturesque kelp forests off the island, Ryder explains his introduction to spearfishing, techniques used in the sport and what drives him in this unique endeavor. \n\nA natural extension of the inspiration behind the Riffe Digi-Tek Camo collection, a collaborative capsule that introduces a first-of-its-kind pattern to three of our most popular watermen models: The Lodown Silicone, The Unit Dive and The Super Unit. The watches are all finished in Riffe\u2019s signature Digi-Tek camouflage adding greater function \u2013 and impact - both in and out of the water. And much like the colors of the ocean, the the patterns of the Riffe Digi-Tek camo vary based on where it is placed on the watch, making each timepiece unique.",
