    "description": "Bob Soven\u2019s approach to life isn\u2019t as much about seizing the moment as it is about letting the moment seize him. Always game for an adventure, new experience, or getting out of his comfort zone, Bob is known for taking life as it comes and making the most out of it. A hobbyist to a fault, Bob hasn\u2019t found something he doesn\u2019t want to try, be it living in a fifth-wheel trailer, bow hunting, free diving, or starring in a reality TV show. While wakeboarding is his passion and career, it has also been his gateway to living the life he wants just the way he wants: without limits or conventional structure.\n\nEdit:\nRyan Marcus\nVeesh\n\nCameras:\nRyan Marcus\nJon Vital\n\nMusic:\nTwo Wooden Stones\n\"Sold My Soul\"\nLooking for the Light\n\nGypsyblood\n\"Endless Summer\"\nCold in the Guestway\nSargent House",
