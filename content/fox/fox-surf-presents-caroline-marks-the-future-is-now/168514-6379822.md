    "description": "This summer Fox Surf\u2019s Caroline Marks earned herself a spot in the history books. Winning every competitive title you can as a women\u2019s amateur surfer in the United States, Caroline won the U.S. Championships, the Volcom World Championships and multiple NSSA National titles. We recently spent some time with her in Southern California and got a little insight into her feelings towards winning, coaching, ear plugs and Hawaiian-style poki. \n\nMusic:\nThe Morning Stars\u2019\n\"Murder of Roman Polanski\"\n\nEdit:\nJensen Young Sik",
