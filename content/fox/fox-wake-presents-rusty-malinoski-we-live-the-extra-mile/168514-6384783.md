    "description": "Rusty Malinoski has always had a different approach to the sport of Wakeboarding than most others. Rusty\u2019s hard core work ethic, confidence and competitive approach has taken him onto winning many National and World championships throughout his career. Growing older now, Rusty still has that competitive drive and desire to want to win at any level and all the time. Rusty hasn\u2019t let off the gas yet. He feels he still has more to share with the sport and his competitors. \n\nEdit:\nVeesh\nRyan Marcus\n\nCameras:\nRyan Marcus\nBYF Films\nSean Kilgus\nTony Augustinack\n\nMusic:\nDark Model\n\u201cAbandoned\u201d \n\nNate Dias\n\u201cJuno\"",
