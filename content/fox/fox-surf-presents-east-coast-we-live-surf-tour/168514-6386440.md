    "description": "This summer the Fox Surf team hit the East Coast in search of stoke and surf. Traveling over 2,000 miles in the Fox Bus, Fox Surf's Ian Walsh, Bruce Irons, Damien Hobgood, Chippa Wilson and Luke and Caroline Marks found little surf but plenty of stoke. Fox Surf teamed up with key retailers and held in store signings, BBQs and fun beach activities while on the East Coast. This video captures the good times retailers and fans shared on the Fox \"We Live\" Surf Tour.\"\n\nMusic: Tomorrow blues by Judson McKinney I gets my boogie on by T bird and the breaks\n\nFilmed and Edited: Jensen Young Sik",
