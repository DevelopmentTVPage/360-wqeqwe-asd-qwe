    "description": "Every year some of the best motocross and surf athletes gather together for Surfercross. This year marked the 15th consecutive year for Surfercross, with a heavy combination of Pro and Industry riders alike. In the pro class, each pro surfer was randomly paired with a pro mx rider, while the industry class was a random mix of desk jockeys. We took over the MX track at Milestone the first day, then hit the surf at Trail 6 in San Clemente the following day. Surfercross is just about the perfect amount of dirt and surf. This event brings together some of the most talented athletes across two industries, into one very unique contest.\n\nMusic:\n\"Blood Red Sky\"\nFreedom Hawk \n\n\"Looking At You\"\nDRGN KING\n\nEditor- Jensen Young Sik",
