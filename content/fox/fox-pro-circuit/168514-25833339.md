    "description": "\u201cWe Race\u201d has been Pro Circuit\u2019s mantra for the past four decades. For a long time it has felt as if they were alone in that effort. Since the beginning, Fox and Pro Circuit have been establishing legendary legacies in differing ways: The steel that drives us forward, and the fabric that binds us together. Combined we have a total of 98 pro championships. Today we join two different families, a blending of two unique backgrounds with a single focus that will forever change the course of history. Forging a strong bond through effort and persistence;\nFrom this day forward, We Race Together.\n\nOriginal Score:\nKemal Golden\nhttp:\/\/soundcloud.com\/kemalgolden",
