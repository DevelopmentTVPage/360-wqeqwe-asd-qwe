    "description": "Today's action sports athletes must be prepared, both physically and mentally, to seize those legendary moments in their respective sports. Whether it's the last two laps of a grueling 30 minute moto in sweltering heat, or dropping into a 30 foot wave breaking over razor-sharp reef, our athletes rely on their preparation to succeed -- and survive.\n\nSpend some time with Ken Roczen as he shares a portion of his training routine in preparation for the AMA Supercross and Motocross championships.\n\nAbout Fox Footwear:\nFrom a heritage deeply rooted in performance products, we strive to build the very best in every category we create.
