    "description": "The FOX BMX demo and team signing at XRYDERZ store at the MainPlace mall was a huge success this past weekend in Santa Ana, CA. The turnout was huge for both the demo and signing. There were plenty of free FOX giveaways, along with a Cult complete bike that was raffled off. Fox heavy hitters, Chase Hawk, Sean Sexton and Russ Barone were onsite and riding stylish as ever, while Catfish hosted the event and was on the mic making the entire crowd laugh. It was an amazing event and an all around great day.
