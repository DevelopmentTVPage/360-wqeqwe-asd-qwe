    "description": "The annual battle between Ronnie Renner and Matt Buyten hit a new high during the Sony Moto X Step Up event at the 2012 X games. The longtime rivals shattered the X Games record for height cleared on their dirtbikes, with Renner ultimately eclipsing a bar set 47 feet off the Staples Center dirt to win his third gold medal and unseat two-time defending champion Buyten. Renner's jump broke the record Buyten set at last year's X Games by 10 feet. The 11-jump, can-you-top-this battle between Renner and Buyten brought thousands of spectators to their feet.",
