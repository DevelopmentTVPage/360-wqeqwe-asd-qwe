    "description": "Riding a dirt bike is an incredibly unique and special experience. It\u2019s unfortunate that not everyone gets to enjoy it at least once in their lifetime. There is a freedom and thrill to it that is unmatched by anything else. \n\nThe fact that many of us get to do it regularly is a blessing.\nThere is something even more amazing about sharing the experience of riding with your friends, or with acquaintances who become friends by the end of the day. Whether it\u2019s trails, track or dunes doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is the common bond of the experience of the adventure. It is a soulful experience that can be both life changing, as well as life reaffirming.\n\nAs someone who lives this moto life, hopefully you already know the feeling. If not, then search it out and find it for yourself.",
