    "description": "Surfing is like nothing else.\nIt's sunburnt backs & bloodshot eyes.\nIt's paddling back out for one more, 10 times.\nSurfing is melting wax & burning sand.\nIt's warm water, salt water, and a dry mouth.\nIt's calling a mate into the best wave of the morning.\nSurfing is tubes & turns & flying down the line.\nIt's head-dips & chop-hops, hoots & high-fives.\nIt's three fins and one fin, two fins and none.\nSurfing is being local yet still searching.\nIt's road-trips, boarding passes & rocking boats.\nIt's a tropical reef & a track through the dunes.\nSurfing is the first view of the ocean every morning.\nSurfing is who we are...\n\nBand: Cabins\nTrack: Golden To Touch\n\n\nDirector of Photography - Andrew Buckley\nPost Production - Short Films",
