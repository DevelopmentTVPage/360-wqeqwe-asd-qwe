    "description": "What do four of surfing's top females do when they're ripped from their busy tour schedule and put on a boat in paradise for a couple of weeks? They get ridiculous: They laugh. Surf perfect waves carelessly. Have fierce fishing competitions. Snorkel. Bronze on the beach. And, of course, laugh a lot more. In other words, they just become normal girls in the absence of the bright lights, glamor and hype -- which at the end of the day, is what they love being the most. \n\nMusic: The Day Summer Fell - The Sand Pebbles\nMusic: Can't You Smell Me Burning - The Maladies",
