    "description": "Surfing is like nothing else. \nIt's frozen hands & fumbling keys. \nIt's being cleaned up by a closeout & coming up laughing. \nSurfing is rubber arms and a dry wetsuit. \nIt's the first duck dive on a cold morning.\nIt's hot food, car heaters & the smell of coffee.\nSurfing is paddling out somewhere you've never been. \nIt's step-ups, broken boards and long swims.\nIt's \"How is it?\" & \"Had a couple?\"\nSurfing is sitting in the lineup alone under a pale winter sun.\nIt's talking story in the car park later.\nIt's the promise of warm water five hours away.\nSurfing is knowing that it's winter somewhere.\nSurfing is who we are...\n\nStarring: Mick Fanning, Owen Wright, Matt Wilkinson\n\nMusic: Nicole Millar\nTrack: Taken",
