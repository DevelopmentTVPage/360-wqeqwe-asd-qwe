He loves exploring British Columbia backcountry on his snowmobile, sharing good times with friends.\n\nWhen Wiley is asked to describe the most epic session from last winter, this what came out.\n\"This past season was by far the most fun I've had filming. There were so many fun sessions and great spots that we rode. It's hard to say which session was the best, basically last winter was a major highlight in my life\"\n\nHis future is bright and based on progression.\n\"As far as the season that's front of me, I am so excited to work on filming another part, and progressing my snowboarding, sledding and backcountry knowledge\"\n\nFilmed by:\nNuulife\nJohn Swestun\nDave Craig\n\nEdited by:\nManu Vivion\n\nwww.ripcurl.com",
