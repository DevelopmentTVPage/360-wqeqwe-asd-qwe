    "description": "Stephanie Gilmore is only 22 years old and she's already a legend. Her paws are immortalized in Huntington Beach's Surfing Walk of Fame. She is officially an icon to every female surfer on the planet. And not surprisingly, she's rubbed off on Alana, Bethany and Tyler quite a bit lately. But in the close quarters of the Quest 1, everyone begins to become a piece of each other. And thank God for that, or Glitter and the Shaman would have never been created.\n\nMusic: Funky Zen Groove - Tack Fu\nMusic: Chakra Superstar - The Winston Giles Orchestra\nMusic: The Day Summer Fell - The Sand Pebbles",
