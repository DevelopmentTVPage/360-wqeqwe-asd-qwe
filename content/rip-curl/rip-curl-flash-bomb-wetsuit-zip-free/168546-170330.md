    "description": "The World's Fastest Drying Wetsuit is now in Zip Free!\n\nThe Flash-Bomb Zip Free is Rip Curl's new Ultimate cold water performance wetsuit.\n\nAs a result of increased stretch from Rip Curl's exclusive E4 neoprene, the design team have engineered a zip free wetsuit that is just as easy to get on and off as a chest zip suit.\n\nIn doing so Flash-Bomb Zip Free boosts the surfing performance benefits by reducing the weight of the wetsuit and increasing the range of stretch during paddle and surfing motions.\n\nKEY PERFORMANCE BENEFITS\nLighter - removal of chest zip and construction requirements decreases the weight. More stretch - full stretch through the chest panel assists in paddling and surfing movements.\nLess water - No water leakage through chest zip\nDesigned for easy on and off - Specifically engineered for function and ease of use.\n\nAfter the success of the Flash-Bomb in 2012 and improvements with E4 neoprene in 2013, Rip Curl is excited to take the World's number 1 voted wetsuit to the next performance level.\n\nTrack: Fuzz\nMusic: Tribe Of Noise\nSource: Getty Images",
