    "description": "Kekoa \"BAM\" Bacalso bursted onto the competitive scene winning everything. Beginning with an NSSA National Title, an ASP World Junior Title, and a WCT Rookie of the Year award, Kekoa was no stranger to hoisting trophies over his head. After falling off tour a few years back, Kekoa has re-emerged as a stand out in the Hawaiian surf scene. From his contagious smile and aloha vibes, to his stand-up pits at Off-The-Wall and power gaffs displacing water all across the 7-Mile Miracle, Surfing Is Everything to Kekoa.\n\nArtist: Mathew Murphy\nTrack: Without Works\n\nEdit: Justin Jung",
