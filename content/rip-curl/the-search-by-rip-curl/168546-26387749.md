    "description": "It's the driving force that lead to the creation of Rip Curl. It's all about pure Searching for Surf and enjoying the beautiful ride along the way. This clip sums up that deep rooted sense of exploration and desire and invites you in for a deeper look, for and at yourself.\n\nWhat is it that makes us Explore?\nThe restless urge to pack up and go.\nWhen the rumor of a perfect wave won't leave your mind.\nThe anticipation, the laughs, the disasters, the surf.\nIt defines who we are are... The Search.\n\nhttp:\/\/thesearch.ripcurl.com\/en\n\nMusic: Hedge Fund\nTrack: Look Who's Back\nhttp:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/hedgefundband\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hedgefundband",
