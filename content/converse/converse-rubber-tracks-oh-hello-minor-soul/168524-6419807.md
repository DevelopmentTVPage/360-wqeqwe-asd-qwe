    "description": "Meet Minor Soul, two brothers who are originally from the UK and moved to Hong Kong at an early age. It was there, during the 18 years they lived there that they picked up music at the ages of 8 and 6 years old and the rest is history. Listen to the band discuss how they slowly progressed into full-fledged musicians, what their creative process entails today, and what recording at Converse Rubber Tracks meant for them.",
