    "description": "The name Kilo Kish was on the tip of everyone's tongue last week in NYC, as the Orlando-bred songstress brought her carefree, whimsical style to venues all over Brooklyn and Manhattan. We caught up with her at 1896 building in Bushwick, as part of our Ready, Set Get Lost series, where she closed the evening with a stunning performance of her single Navy (MeLo X Remix) - complete with visuals and some crazy shadows. \n\nThanks to Guitar Center, Gretsch Drums, and Zildjian cymbals.",
