    "description": "The Dillinger Escape Plan have always been a band that has defied convention. Whether it be their albums or live show you come to expect the unexpected. One of the most unique aspects of the band is how they have had over fourteen members pass through the band over the years and yet continue to evolve their sound and grow their fan base. We sat down the band to discuss what it means to be in the Dillinger Escape Plan and how this band has molded each band member.",
