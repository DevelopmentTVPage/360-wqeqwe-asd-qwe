    "description": "Australian street artists The Yok, Sheryo and Alex Lehours, with help the Australian community, collaborated to transform a site in Fremantle Australia with a fully democratic community mural. Via the hashtag #sneakerclashfreo hundreds of creative submissions were sent in from people across Australia with suggestions on what would appear on the wall, with the top 20 selected by the artists and brought to life on the streets with a burst of color and creativity. The completed work remains as a permanent piece for the public to enjoy.",
