    "title": "Converse Rubber Tracks: In Search of Sound with Fool's Gold",
    "description": "Fool's Gold artists explore the borough of Brooklyn, NY to record sounds found within local business. Starting in the neighborhood of Williamsburg, Flosstradamus and Party Supplies chat with Crest Hardware\u00b9s owner Joe and capture the banging of trash can lids, gravel on the ground and chain links. Party Supplies then meet up with Donnis at the Post Bike shop in Bushwick and together, they record wheels turning, an air pump and bike bells. The final stop finds Fool\u00b9s Gold Founder Nick Catchdubs and label manager Benny J in Greenpoint at The Meat Hook, where the duo meet the owner Brent and together record the slicing sound of the meat cutting machine and the crackling of the paper as the meat is wrapped up.",
