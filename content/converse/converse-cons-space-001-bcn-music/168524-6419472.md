    "description": "On Saturday 18 May 2013, Converse took over a disused section of the Port of Barcelona to create the first CONS SPACE, an initiative to transform disused urban space through skateboarding, art and music. \n\nLocal artists Txemy Basuelto, Fernando Elvira and Ruben Sanchez collaborated with Converse skaters Kenny Anderson and Pontus Alv to design a skate spot inspired by the abandoned industrial materials and location - then joined by The Bots, Spank Rock, The Black Lips, and Crocodiles to take the party through to the night.",
