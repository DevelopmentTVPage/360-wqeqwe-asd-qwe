    "description": "Formed in Detroit, Michigan in the early seventies, Death was a heavy rock band that \"was punk before punk was punk\". Although they stopped recording in the late seventies, they recently reformed after one their sons found the records in the attic (those same sons went on to form Rough Francis). We were lucky enough to have them drop in to see Red Light Radio at their pop up studio in Austin, Texas.",
