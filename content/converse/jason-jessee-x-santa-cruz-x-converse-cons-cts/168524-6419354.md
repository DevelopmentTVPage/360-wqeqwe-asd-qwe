    "description": "In celebration of 40 years of Santa Cruz Skateboards, Converse has collaborated on some limited edition skate sneakers. Long time Santa Cruz Pro and Converse Ambassador Jason Jessee provided the inspiration for the Converse CONS CTS pack in both Mid and Ox. \nTo celebrate the sneaker collaboration we helped Jason build a classic vert ramp near his home in Santa Cruz. The video shows Jason helping to \"build\" the ramp and then proceeding to shred it in classic Jason fashion.\n\nFilmed by Joe Perrin & Jordan Tabayoyon\nEdited by Joe Perrin\nFeaturing the song \"launch of the spiders\" by powerflex 5",
