    "title": "Converse Rubber Tracks Austin: Black Atlass \"Paris\" Live",
    "description": "Black Atlass; music belies the 18 year old London, Ontario native's age. A recent signee of Fools Gold, Alex Fleming headed to Austin as a hugely buzzed over act for his one man show that puts him directly in line with his r'n'b contemporaries. He stopped by Converse Rubber Tracks Austin as the week was wrapping up and delivered a gorgeous version of his new single \"Paris\" - before performing at the official Fools Gold showcase that evening, as the dirty, dusty week in Austin came to a close.",
