    "description": "In April 2015, Converse showed its love for Boston by hosting a five-night series of free live shows at the Sinclair in Cambridge. Up-and-coming artists Rozamov, Bent Shapes, Michael Christmas, Radclyffe Hall and The Young Leaves were selected from recent sessions at the Converse Rubber Tracks studios and invited to share the stage with musical icons including Dinosaur Jr., The Replacements, Passion Pit, Slayer and Descendants. \n\nWe spoke with the bands to find out what it is that makes Boston home to one of America\u2019s greatest musical communities.",
