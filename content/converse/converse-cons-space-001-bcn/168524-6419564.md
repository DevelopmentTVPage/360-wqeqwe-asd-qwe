    "description": "On Saturday 18 May 2013, Converse took over a disused section of the Port of Barcelona to create the first CONS SPACE, an initiative to transform disused urban space through skateboarding, art and music. Kenny Anderson and Pontus Alv collaborated with local artists Txemy Basuelto, Fernando Elvira and Ruben Sanchez to design a skate spot inspired by the abandoned industrial materials and incredible location. They were joined by Rune Glifberg, Tom Remillard, Remy Taviera, Javier Mendizabal, Jerome Campbell, Harry Lintell, Danny Sommerfeld and Ben Raemers for an epic all day session. CONS SPACE 001 BCN wrapped up with live music from The Bots and Black Lips.",
