    "title": "Churrasco Eletrico \"Impostores\" - Converse Rubber Tracks: Track Of The Week",
    "description": "The single \"Impostores\" by Churrasco El\u00e9trico is this week's \"Track of the Week\". The band came to Rubber Tracks Studio in S\u00e3o Paulo with a song they had already written, but once they started recording, new elements developed in the song. Churrasco El\u00e9trico used the studio's huge selection of instruments to find the sounds that best fit the track's vintage feel. Inspired by music of the 60's, the band worked with the Rubber Tracks engineer to give the song a modern twist.",
