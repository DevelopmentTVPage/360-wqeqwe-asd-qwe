    "description": "The single \"Algu\u00e9m Pra Dizer\" by Le Blanche is this week's \"Track of the Week\". When the band arrived to Rubber Tracks Studio in S\u00e3o Paulo, they came fully prepared with chord diagrams and notes for the song they were planning to record. Le Blanche quickly became comfortable in the professional studio setting once they began tracking. At the end of the session the band agreed that this was the best experience for them as musicians.",
