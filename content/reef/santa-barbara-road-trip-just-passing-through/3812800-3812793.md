    "description": "Mornings are chilly. Campfire chilly. Hot thermos of coffee chilly. Late sunrises. North swells. But it\u2019s a new day, a new season to get your feet on a new path.\n\nWe\u2019re ready for this new season with offerings like the Reef Outhaul and Ridge - clean, simple styling and comfort for life on the road. And of course timeless pieces for mid-latitude moods from our Shelter Supply collection. For the ladies, it\u2019s all about the mattress-soft quilted foambeds of the Reef Mayuta and Summer TX. This is when things open up, when we see each new corner of the winding coastal road in a new light.\n\nSong: Rockets and Jets. Artist: Hospitality",
