    "description": "The sea speaks to us. She gives spiritual meaning in a world of chaos. She gives reason for spontaneous travel at a moments notice. And she is that wonderful escape for the mind, body and soul. Reef Ambassador Darshan Gooch dances with her, finding synchronicity, balance and meaning, all in the spirit of 'just passing through'.\n\nVideo by Adam Warmington\nWords: 'The Sea Is My Brother' by Jack Kerouac\nMusic: Rough Rugged Road Blues, Bumble Bee Slim",
