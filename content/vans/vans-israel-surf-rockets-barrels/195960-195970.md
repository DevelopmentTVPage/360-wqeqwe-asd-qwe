    "title": "Vans Israel Surf - Rockets & Barrels",
    "description": "The Israeli Vans team has waited for the right swell, which hit as the rockets started firing on Tel Aviv, and delivered two days of epic surf in the Tel Aviv area. A mix of barrels, carves and airs with the right sound track provided by the Tel Aviv garage punk group, The Crotches, created a real off the wall surf video. We chose to show only surf and aloha vibes and not rockets in the Israeli sky, enjoy. \n\nDirecting, Editing & Film: Yakir Avrahami\nMusic: \"Zara Zrora\" by The Crotches\nVans Israel Team Manager: Arthur Rashkovan\nSurfers: Edo Minsker, Tal Asayag, David Noy, Oran Weiss, Arthur Rashkovan, Nitai Rostchild",
