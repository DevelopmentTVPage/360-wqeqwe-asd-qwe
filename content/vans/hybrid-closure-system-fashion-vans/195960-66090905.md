    "description": "Vans Hybrid Boa System: Featured on the men\u2019s Infuse and Implant, the Hybrid Boa configuration represents the best of both worlds, combining traditional laces with Boa closure focused on the critical instep area of the boot. \nThis configuration allows riders to lace their boots tighter than what can be achieved with traditional laces, as well as make on-the-fly adjustments. \nThe Custom Slide Guide enables further customization of the fit and flex of the boot. \n\nMusic: \"Midnight Summer Scheme\" by Zac Marben\n\n\nAbout Vans:\nVans\u00ae, a VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) brand, is the original action sports footwear, apparel and accessories brand.
