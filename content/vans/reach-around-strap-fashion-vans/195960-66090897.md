    "description": "Reach Around:\nMuch more than just a standard cuff strap. The Reach Around strap is attached to the inside shell of the boot and provides the versatility to wrap around either the internal liner or the exterior tongue of the shell allowing a rider to quickly and easily customize both the fit and response on their boot. Because the Reach Around strap is attached to the shell of the boot no movement is wasted and turning response is maximized. You\u2019ll find the Reach Around System featured on the men\u2019s Sequal, Implant & V-66 boots.\n\nMusic: \"Midnight Summer Scheme\" by Zac Marben\n\nAbout Vans:\nVans\u00ae, a VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) brand, is the original action sports footwear, apparel and accessories brand.
