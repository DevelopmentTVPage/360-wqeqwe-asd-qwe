    "description": "Flex Control System: Removable tongue stiffeners allow riders to custom-tune their boot flex. \nSlide them both in for maximum support and response, use just one to provide either increased response to the inside or outside of the boot or leave them out for a softer flexing more forgiving ride. \nOver the course of the season, as your boots break in and soften up, you can add the tongue stiffeners back in, extending the life of your boots. \nThe Flex Control System is featured on the men\u2019s Infuse and Sequal boots.\n\nMusic: \"Midnight Summer Scheme\" by Zac Marben\n\nAbout Vans:\nVans\u00ae, a VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) brand, is the original action sports footwear, apparel and accessories brand.
