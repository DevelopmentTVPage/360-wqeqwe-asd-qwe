    "description": "While visiting Shoe Giving Partner Global Communities , we learned how TOMS purchases are contributing to the future success of children and their families. Global Communities provides new TOMS Shoes as part of their school uniform program, providing orphans and vulnerable children better access to education.\n\nIn addition, in their commitment to helping families in need, Global Communities also provides new TOMS to children whose families complete financial trainings. These trainings in lending and savings teach families how to become resistant to the economic challenges they may face daily.",
