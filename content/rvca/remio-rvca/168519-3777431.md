    "description": "REMIO is a bit of a mystery and he prefers it that way. a prolific graffiti artist originally from Norway, he has found a way to make his mark in almost every country in the world. He is a member of the VTS crew and comes to RVCA on strong commendations from RVCA friends Barry McGee and Os Gemeos. And like many talented artists who learn their craft at street level, REMY has started to make a successful entry into the gallery and museum world.\n\nVideo by Brandon Jensen, Song 'Surf Doom' by Sandy Pussy\n\nShop RVCA x REMIO: https:\/\/www.rvca.com\/shop\/mens-specia...",
