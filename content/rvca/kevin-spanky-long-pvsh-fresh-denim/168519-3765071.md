    "description": "A session with Kevin 'Spanky' Long in his RVCA Signature PVSH\/FRESH denim.\nRVCA PVSH\/FRESH denim is a series of jeans designed and created for the everyday rigors of skateboarding. Featuring a blend of natural cotton and synthetic denim blend, PVSH\/FRESH jeans fully embody the RVCA Balance of Opposites ethos. The natural cotton fibers provide traditional workwear appearance and durability while the synthetic denim blend provide moisture-management properties that transport perspiration away from your body to keep you cool, dry, and fresh.\n\nVideo by Brandon Jensen, Song by Cherry Glazerr courtesy of Burger Records.",
