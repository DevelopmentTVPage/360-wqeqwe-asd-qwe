    "description": "The Element team took the newest collection of product to Chile to discover the culture and landscape, and to ensure the products were made to endure. Watch the story unfold and win items from the collection on instagram by following @elementusa and using #keepdiscovering.\n\nFor the past two decades the one thing that has remained constant is our drive to see the world differently. Element has taken inspiration from all environments; from the top of the Andes to the streets in our own backyard. From the moment we hit the road, our ability to discover never ends, our enthusiasm for the next adventure is what drives us forward.\n\nEdited by:\nKirk Dianda\nMark Stewart\n\nFilmed by:\nCole Mathews\nKirk Dianda\n\nPhotography by:\nBrian Gaberman\n\nSoundtrack by:\nLoren Humphrey",
