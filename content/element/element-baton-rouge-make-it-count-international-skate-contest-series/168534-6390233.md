    "description": "The Baton Rouge stop of the MAKE IT COUNT 2013 international Contest series was amazing. The caliber of skateboarding in the south is a force to be reckoned with. There were a handfull of dudes killing it, and it was hard to pick a winner, but in the end Lance Chapin out shined the rest, and won himself a trip to the finals at Element Skate Camp, and a trip to the Berrics with the Element team.",
