    "description": "Elemental Awareness teamed up with the WLCAC in Watts, CA to bring the Element \"No Board Left Behind\" program to the kids for the Holidays. The kids brought their used boards and we cut them into cruisers and provided new trucks, wheels, bearings and hardware. After all the cutting was done, we all headed over to the skate park for a session with the new skateboards. Special thanks goes out to the WLCAC and everyone who came out!",
