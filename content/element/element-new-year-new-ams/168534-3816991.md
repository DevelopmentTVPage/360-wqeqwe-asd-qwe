    "description": "2014 was one hell of a year for us: Madars Apse turned pro, Greyson Fletcher conquered massive transitions far and wide, Chad Tim Tim released yet another mind boggling part in Dekline's \"True Blue\", and the boys completely destroyed Thrasher's \"King of the Road.\"\n\n2015 is here, and and we are pleased to welcome three new Ams to the family: Chris Colbourn, Ethan Loy, and Dominick Walker. \n\nFilmed by Mark Stewart, Cole Mathews, and Evan Walsh\n\nMusic: \"E\" by No Joy",
