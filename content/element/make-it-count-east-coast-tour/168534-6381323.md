    "description": "Join Brandon Westgate, Donny Barley and Chris \u201cCookie\u201d Colbourn as they travel up the east coast on the Element Make it Count East Coast Tour. The Make it Count tour visited Philadelphia, PA, Fredrick, MD and Burlington, VT. It was a unique experience to get to skate with kids from all over the East Coast and share memories with everyone along the way. We also visited a bunch of friends from Kinetic, Pitcrew, Orchard, 2nd Nature, Ambler, Solstice, Talent and even got to catch up with former Torque pro Chad Kramer and Element Alumni Jake Rupp. It was a great tour and we will not soon forget the people and places we visited on the road. Special thanks to Oakley, New Balance Numeric, The Mountain and Stance Socks for helping make this tour happen.\nRead More",
