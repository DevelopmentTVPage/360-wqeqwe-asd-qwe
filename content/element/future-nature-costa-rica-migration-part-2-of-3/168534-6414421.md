    "description": "While following Amateurus for Future Nature, we ended up in the jewel of the equator, Costa Rica. We trailed the pod from the sunken seas to the highest mountain tops, surrounded by a volcanic skyline. \n\nMigrations is a three-part series of behind-the-scenes footage from Future Nature, The Element Am Video. Shot on location in Mallorca, Costa Rica, and the Basque Country in Spain, this raw footage offers an in-depth look at Amateurus, the amateur skateboarder. Migrations stars Boo Johnson, Evan Smith, Julian Davidson, Madars Apse, and Nick Garcia.\n\nFilmed by:\nCole Mathews\nMarc Falkenstien\nMark Stewart",
