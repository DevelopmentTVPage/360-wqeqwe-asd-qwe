    "description": "Growing up in Manhattan Beach, with a father whose surfed over 1,000 days in a row, young Mason was destined to be in the water, but as fate would have it his calling was in the streets. Mason was first noticed by Element at a MAKE IT COUNT contest in 2010, where he displayed a style, power and pop well beyond his age. As his bag of tricks progressed, his body eventually caught up with the size of his head, and he took off. With a great attitude and superb trick selection Mason is set to be your new favorite skater in no time.",
