    "description": "The Bethlehem, PA stop of the Element MAKE IT COUNT Contest Series was one of the best stops yet, with kids traveling from up and down the East Coast to come shred. Everyone was ripping, but when the time was up it was Joeseph Uva who killed it the hardest and won himself an all expenses paid trip to the MAKE IT COUNT finals, and a trip to The Berrics with the Element team. Thank you to everyone who came out to skate with us, and a Special thanks to Homebase skate shop for holding it down and helping us run the event. We'll see you at the next stop!",
