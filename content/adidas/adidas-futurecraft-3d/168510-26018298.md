We have developed proprietary 3D printing technology, delivering a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d product in an entirely new way. Our 3D-printed material not only allows us to make a great running shoe, but also to use performance data to drive truly bespoke experiences, meeting the needs of any athlete. \n\nCreating something totally new is a journey, and we\u2019re excited to have you come along with us.",
