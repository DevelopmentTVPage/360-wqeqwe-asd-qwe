    "description": "For creators. By creators. This is Futurecraft Leather.\n\nIt is our approach. It is our direction. It is our journey.\nFuturecraft Leather is a prototype and a statement of intent. By reimagining how to work with leather, a material that is synonymous with the adidas brand, we have created a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d product in an entirely new way. Milling leather allows us to push the limits of our craft, bringing new form and function to a traditional material.\n\nThis new innovation meets a true adidas Originals icon, in the form of the Superstar. With just 45 pairs available worldwide, Futurecraft Leather is an homage to the Superstar\u2019s years since its inception.",
