If you believe in any of these... if you believe in being \"born skilled\", one thing\u2019s for sure: you know nothing about what it takes to reach true athleticism.\n\nIf you know what sports are, you understand the meaning of dedication, determination, repetition, effort, listening to your coach, taking criticism, working hard, training, training more, overcoming limits, giving your best and taking every challenge as if it was forever or never. \n\nAmidst the setting of Rio de Janeiro, we celebrate sports with a Brazilian athlete training in the most unusual spot, the P\u00e3o de A\u00e7ucar (Sugar Loaf). \n\nDirection: \nLuigi Cani  \nMikael Santiago \nCaio Amato \n \nExecutive Production:\nRodrigo Selva \u201cCalota\"\n \nProduction:\nLuana Calainho\nGilson \n \nAssistant Production:\nMariana Gomes \nEduardo Rodrigues\n \nFinal Cut:\nPedro Dias \nSabrina Gortz",
