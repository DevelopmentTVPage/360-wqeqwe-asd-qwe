    "description": "It's the voice inside you that gets drowned by 120 heartbeats a minute. It is the silence before the game that is smashed by the cheering of thousands and thousands of people. It is a life lecture that tells you not to stop now. It's the smallest thing but also the biggest. Make them stop breathing and blow them away. \n\nTennis is for those who will never be silenced.\nScream -- with pain and with joy.\nStay hungry -- for the victory and shouting.\n\nEveryone knows:\nOnly those who are quiet will be forgotten. But tennis never forgets.\n\nAre you ready to smash the silence?",
