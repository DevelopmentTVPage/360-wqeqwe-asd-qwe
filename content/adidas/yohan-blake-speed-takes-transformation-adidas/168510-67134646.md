    "description": "Four years ago, nerves and inexperience stopped Yohan Blake from achieving his goal. He was young and scared. Now he\u2019s confident and full of belief. He\u2019s a different person, and he\u2019s pumped up and ready to go. Speed takes transformation. Blake is a creator of speed.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nWarning: This video contains flashing imagery. Viewer discretion advised.\n\nFrom the pool to the hockey field.
