    "description": "Though he\u2019s never pursued any kind of recognition for his photography, Andrew Reynolds has been consistently shooting pictures since his early days in Florida. Residing in shoe boxes at his house are thousands of polaroids and 35mm prints: Childhood images from the 80s, snapshots from Birdhouse tours, hang-overs from the Warner Ave Piss Drunx days, and shots taken of everybody that stopped by Drew\u2019s house in the last few years.\n\nThis collection, curated by Patrick O' Dell, was shown for the first time at KNOWN Gallery in Los Angeles on May 14th, 2014.",
