    "description": "Altamont is proud to introduce our newest collaboration with Erin M. Riley.\n\nErin M. Riley lives and works in Brooklyn, NY, but grew up in Cape Cod. She\u2019s spent years working in her studio, while traveling in her pickup truck hosting artist residencies throughout the country.\n\nBeing a woman inspires her work, through her teen years in chat rooms, as well as modern day digital imagery through the lens of her computer and phone cameras. Erin\u2019s spent her recent years pursuing images people share, adding her own, and uses wool on a loom to present her own personal art from it.",
