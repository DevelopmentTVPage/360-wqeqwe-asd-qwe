    "description": "etnies x Benny L x FITBIKECO. collaboration is new for Spring 13! Check the edit here, complete with English subtitles for those of you who don't understand... er... English? The collection is a dream come true for Ben Lewis. Involved at every level of the process, Ben personally selected the classic etnies RVM for this collaboration along with the navy and red colors that perfectly match his Fit bike and the custom graphics featured on the footbeds and outer heel. As Ben\u2019s favorite etnies style, the RVM\u2019s midtop supports and protects his ankles while the sole is nice and grippy without sacrificing the flexibility needed when riding.\nFor more info check: etnies.com\/shop\/fit-bike-collection\/",
