    "description": "As a destination historically known for its abandonment and desolation, Slab City is now the home of nomads, squatters, snowbirds and the remains of barracks from World War II. On the most recent etnies endeavor, Willow, Nick Garcia and Julian Davidson took their new signature colorways of the Marana Vulc on a journey into the desert. They embarked in search of skate exploration and put this shoe's blend of strength and style to the test. What they discovered was stark. Slab City is what they found. Armed with power tools, bags of cement mix, and buckets of water, the crew stirred up some skate creation and managed to throw hammers in a desolate location.",
