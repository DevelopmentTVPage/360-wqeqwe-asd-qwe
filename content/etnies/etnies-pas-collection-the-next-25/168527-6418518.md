    "description": "It\u2019s etnies 25th birthday and Pierre-Andre Senizergues is celebrating all around the world with his latest signature collection which features his original pro model, the Senix. For this collection, Pierre-Andre drew inspiration from four major cities that have influenced not only his skating, but consequently the evolution of etnies: Paris, France; Hong Kong, China; Vancouver, Canada and Los Angeles, California. He also hand-picked exclusive retailers who have long been supporters of etnies in each key city: colette (Paris); Double Park (Hong Kong), Livestock (Vancouver) and Blends (Los Angles). Looking to the future at what the NEXT 25 years hold, we explore unexpected materials, laser-etching and a production process offset for a completely carbon neutral collection worth celebrating!",
