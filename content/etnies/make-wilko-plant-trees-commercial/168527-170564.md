    "description": "Always read the fine print! Matt Wilko Wilkinson learned the hard way but we have no regrets because for every pair of his Dapper or Dory sold, Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest will be one tree closer to complete reforestation! As far as we're concerned, that's worth a little bush block on a date or awkward morning wood at Wilko's expense. Shop Wlko's Dapper & Dory and the rest of the etnies Buy A Shoe, Plant A Tree Collection and Make Wilko Plant Trees!",
