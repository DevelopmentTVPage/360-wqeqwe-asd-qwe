    "description": "etnies is following up the Marana you know in red with an all-over light grey version with yellow hits. It may be a new color but it's still the same style with all the advanced specs that make it the longest-lasting shoe Ryan Sheckler has ever skated. The etnies Marana was designed to blend strength and style, making it perfect for a Ryan Sheckler signature model. This shoe was carefully crafted, piece by piece, to endure skateboarding. Its fused-on injected rubber toe cap makes it super hard to wear through, the lightweight and impact-resistant STI Evolution\u2122 Foam midsole doesn't pack out, enhancing the cushioning of the Polyurethane footbed and the non-slip grip outsole's thick herringbone tread with deep grooves just doesn't wear down.\n\nMusic: Aer - Like the Way",
