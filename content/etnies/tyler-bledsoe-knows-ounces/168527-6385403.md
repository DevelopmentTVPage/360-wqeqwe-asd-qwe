    "description": "The etnies Highlight is a unique skate shoe because it consists of zero rubber. With 100% STI Evolution Foam in the footbed, midsole and outsole, we created an incredibly lightweight and comfortable skate shoe. The STI Evolution Foam contains durable rebound foam properties, making the shoe more resistant to high-impact skating by creating maximum cushioning on those brutal landings. \nShown here in Tyler Bledsoe's signature colorway: Black\/ Camo.\n\"This new foam is what I\u2019ve needed for a while in shoes, the pinnacle of lightweight\" - Tyler Bledsoe",
