Since then, thanks to customer support, etnies has planted more than 200,000 trees throughout Costa Rica and Brazil! Now, etnies has sprouted a brand new motion graphic video showing what this initiative is all about and why etnies continues to cultivate it each year. View the Buy A Shoe, Plant A Tree collection",
