    "title": "Introducing Toshikazu Nozaka for etnies",
    "description": "etnies is proud to introduce a limited edition collaboration with contemporary artist Toshikazu Nozaka. As a professional skateboarder in the 90s, Nozaka found another outlet for his creativity in traditional Japanese tattoos. Though rooted in spirituality, he brings the ancient art to today's masses with an undeniable Western influence. Still as apparent as ever, in both his art and his skateboarding, are the clean, smooth lines we've come to appreciate as Nozaka style. We present the etnies Nozaka Collection.",
