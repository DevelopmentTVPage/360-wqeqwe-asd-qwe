    "description": "etnies\u2019 team rider Chris Del Moro is a constant advocate for the environment, appreciating the Earth in every way he can. With the 2011 TransparentSea Voyage, he was part of a small crew of eight surfers, artists, musicians and environmentalists who took a journey down the California coast to follow the migration of the California Grey Whale from Santa Barbara to Baja, Mexico. As part of TransparentSea\u2019s overall campaign to highlight coastal environmental issues, with particular attention given to cetaceans (whales and dolphins), the 2011 TransparentSea Voyage was the organization\u2019s second journey and one that hopes to increase awareness of the plight of animals in our oceans and our responsibility to improve the conditions in their water habitat.",
