    "description": "There is something about the new lightweight, breathable etnies Scout that the guys on the etnies skate, surf and BMX teams are all drawn to. When they aren\u2019t on their boards or out riding, this is the shoe they wear while on the road, discovering new spots or simply living life to the fullest. The etnies Scout has the comfort needed to make it the perfect companion to keep the spirit of adventure alive for anyone, anywhere. The path is yours to choose, and the Scout is there to guide you along the journey.",
