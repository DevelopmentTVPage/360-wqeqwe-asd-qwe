    "description": "After smashing into 1st place in the 2011 etnies tube rider challenge, etnies UK surfer Tom Butler has continued to seek out some big challenging, dangerous slabs around the UK and Ireland. On a constant vigil for deep low pressure systems, Tom continuously chases the best swells and has captured this slice of cold water magic to get you amped.\n\nFreezing cold winters are not a thing to be afraid of according to Tom. This is heavy duty hardcore British surfing at its best. Grab a cup of tea and put your feet up.",
