    "description": "Axel Cruysberghs and two of his friends from Belgium made the 20 hour trek to Florida a few weeks ago. Competing at the Tampa Am event was just part of the plan. When Axel failed to make the cut, he took it as an excuse to use the time and skate the streets together with Dutch etnies rider Douwe Macare. The big rims and facial tattoos aren\u2019t the only witnesses to the 8 am skate sessions. Willem Vleugels caught some moving images and Switn gathered photographs for a Tampa Am \u2018zine: \n\nAfter 5 days of crazy impressions, skating and jet lag, they barely made it onto the airplane to Brussels in time. Feeling exhausted but ever so content.",
