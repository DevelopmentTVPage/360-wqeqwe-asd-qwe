    "title": "Introducing the etnies Skyline Fall 13 Collection",
    "description": "Summer\u2019s over and etnies created the Skyline Collection to keep you warm and dry during the cold, wet winter days ahead.  Tested by pro snowboarders JP Walker and Joe Sexton, the footwear and apparel in the etnies Skyline Collection are made with features to withstand the elements like gusseted tongues, D-rings, faux fur linings, Wax coatings, STI Repel and more.\nJP and Joe spend much of the coldest months of the year in the streets filming for their next snowboard video part. These two have mastered the art of running gear that fits their individual style, while withstanding the winter weather. This collection has proven itself everywhere from the crowded skyscraper lined city streets to desolate mountain towns.\nFilmed on location throughout the Lower East Side of NYC, JP and Joe took a break from snowboarding to spend some time skating and cruising in NYC before catching flights back to the mountains.",
