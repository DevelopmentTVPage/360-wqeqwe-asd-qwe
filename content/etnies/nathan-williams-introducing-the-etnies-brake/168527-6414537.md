    "title": "Nathan Williams - Introducing the etnies Brake",
    "description": "The Brake is a cupsole shoe that features more durable rubber on the toe and heel area to endure the rigors of using your foot as a brake on the tire. The BMX-inspired outsole features a herringbone step pattern designed to grip pedals, but also release when needed without tearing. A denser EVA shank in the midsole arch provides extra protection and stability from the pedals without sacrificing pedal feel, while softer EVA on the toe and heel provide extra flexibility and overall comfort.\n\nIn working with the designers to create his \u201cBrake\u201d colorway, Williams incorporated details inspired from his Native American heritage.\n\n\"It's a huge honor to be able to work with everybody at etnies designing this shoe, and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out,\u201d said Williams. \u201cEverything, down to even the leather laces, the arrow head and the feather insole art came out exactly how I wanted.\"",
