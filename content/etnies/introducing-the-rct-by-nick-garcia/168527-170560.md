    "title": "Introducing the RCT by Nick Garcia",
    "description": "A talented skateboarder and photographer, Nick Garcia combined his two passions on his new signature colorway of the etnies RCT. Nick's RCT takes inspiration and elements from his Canon AE-1 35mm camera on the heels of the shoes showing the focus and aperture markings, and on the footbeds highlighting a filmstrip and his photography. Even the etnies RAP bar on the side of the shoe is modeled after the leather wrapped body of his camera.\nThe Nick Garcia RCT (black\/white) is available now on etnies.com and at finer skate shops globally.\nSee more of Nick's photography and the etnies RCT at http:\/\/etni.es\/nick-garcia-rct",
