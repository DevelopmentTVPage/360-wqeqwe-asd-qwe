    "description": "In celebration of the Koston 2 release we took on an epic challenge, to travel the length and breadth of Europe and recreate Koston's famous Chomp Ollie. \nServing up slices of pizza and good vibes all round we hooked up with Nike SB team riders from each country and threw down the gauntlet to see who had the best Chomp Ollie out there. \n6 countries, 16 cities, 8 couches, over 6000 truck miles, a trailer load of pizza and some special guest appearances.",
