    "description": "UP FROM THE UNDERCROFT\nEmerica UK welcomes Casper Brooker\nBy Henry Edwards-Wood\n\nLondon's Casper Brooker has been quietly carving himself a space on the UK team for a while now and his hard work has paid off. Heroin skateboards, Stella Supply hardware and Slam City Skates already have his back as he is steadily steamrollering up the ranks.  You may ask 'why is his welcome clip is filmed solely at Southbank?', it's simple... We don't forget who we are or where we are from. Well done Casper, we are proud to welcome you to the UK team.",
