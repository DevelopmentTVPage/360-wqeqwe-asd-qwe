    "description": "Check out the most talked about snow goggle on the market from Dragon, The Advanced Projects X. \n\nThis action packed video features footage of Dragon's top team riders including Gigi Ruf, Luke Mitrani, and many others as they test the Advanced Projects X goggles at the R & D Cabin in Silverton and in AK. There is also exclusive CG footage of the premium technology around the fully frameless lens system which gives riders the most peripheral vision and performance in the toughest snow conditions out there. \n\nAdvanced Projects X products by Dragon have superior design, innovation, and a minimalist style. Performance and design innovation are at the heart of every new product in the Advanced Projects X category and the snow goggle line for 2012\/13 season is a reflection of this. Being the first fully frameless goggle with patented lens technology, the bar has been set.",
