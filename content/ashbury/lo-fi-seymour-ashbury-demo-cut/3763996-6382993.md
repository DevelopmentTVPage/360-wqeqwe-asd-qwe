    "description": "It was a very wet day up at Mt. Seymour for the 6th Annual Ashbury Demo so I decided to keep my camera dry and shoot with the iPhone. With all the weather, both phones I was using kept dying on me, so this is what we got. The day was super fun and everybody was psyched. This is snowboarding, there's nothing you can do about the weather!",
