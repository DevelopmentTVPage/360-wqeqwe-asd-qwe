    "description": "FOOTAGE DISCLAIMER: I let Mike handle the camera for a while at the banks and he didn't know how to use it. So ease up on your critique of the filming!\n\nThis time we took TOTF to our what is most of our old stomping grounds, Corona. In order of appearance: EJ Collins, Chris Harris, Tim Mendez, Dan Rhoades, Matt Finelli, Joe Ward, Rich Dodds, Josh Brubaker, Lance Hakker, and even Mike Hakker made it out this time.\n\nIf you think you're too old, too fat, or too busy for skateboarding... then it's time to take it to the streets again.",
