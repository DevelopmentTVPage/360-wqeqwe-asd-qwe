    "description": "Breathable, durable and lightweight. Friluft has excellent ventilation thanks to the 'Fri Luft Ventilation' system, with mesh and air columns in the back that enable air to circulate freely. Well thought-out storage in the large main compartment, and the expanding stretch side pockets are large enough for 1-litre bottles. The elastic front pocket can hold a rain suit, for example. Smart design allows you to attach trekking poles without obstructing access to the front and side pockets. The shoulder straps are ventilated and ergonomical. The comfortable hip belt has smart pockets for keys, camera, telephone, etc. Rain protection included.",
