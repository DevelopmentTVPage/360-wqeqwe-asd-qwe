    "description": "The Annual Sidfish surf series gathered English competitors under cloudy skies and the mist that is quite common in Cornwall at this time of the year. Porthtowan's beach and sand banks got smashed during the heavy winter storms and due to this a lot of the sand has disappeared , with some new bits of reef showing up on the sand around mid to low tide. The event went well despite the poor conditions and the waves cleaned up for the Pro Am finals.\n\nThanks to everyone who helped out at the event and especially Josh Ward and the judges, Jack Clinton and misses, and the Blue Bar.\n\n\n- Music - \nSong: Mumma Wants To Go Surfing\nArtist: Ozzie Wright\nRelease: Ozzy Wrongs Ukulele Songs",
