    "description": "Similar to years past the Unbound terrain park professionals put together a super fun site that included a good mix of creative features and solid rail staples. This year's contest set-up included: a 40 ft round down bar, a bonk to dance floor, and skate plaza style brick planter creation (aka the brick yard). It was a great site to wet our appetites for the $20,000 Championships on April 21, 2012 \n\nResults: \n\n15 & Under Winners \n1st: Joshua Douglas \n2nd: Pat Fava \n3rd: Judd Henkes \n4th: Brock Crouch \n5th: Matt Williams \n\n16 & Over Winners \n1st: Burne Carraway \n2nd: Plake Pasher \n3rd: Thomas Baxter \n4th: Steve Lally \n5th: Gabe Schamberg \n\nGirls Open Division Winners: \n1st: Mariah Dugan \n2nd: Joanna Dzierzawski \n3rd: Nirvana Ortanez \n4th: Danika Duffy \n5th: Erin McCabe \n\nOpen Division Winners: \n1st: Frank Knab \n2nd: Scott Hoffman \n3rd: Garrett Warnick \n4th: Matt Guntert \n5th: Jimmy Goodman \n\nElectric's Gooeyest Move of the Event: \n\"Steezy Matt\" Isacc\n\n- Music -\nSong: \"Snow Day\"\nArtist: Broken Gold\nRelease: Recovery Journal",
