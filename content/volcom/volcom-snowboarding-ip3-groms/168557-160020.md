    "description": "Following up on last year's immensely successful and creative #IP2 series, Volcom has once again partnered with SNOWBOARDER for the next installment of rider-produced videos, aptly named, #IP3. Over the next few months, expect to see an eclectic barrage of edits from the stacked Volcom ranks. First up, the Volcom groms make it very clear that style doesn't pay attention to how old--or young--you may be. Featuring Cody Warble, Brock Crouch, Jake Selover, Alex Rodway, Hunter Wood, Zack Normandin, and the rest of the underagers at The Launch at Bear Mountain.\n\ndirected, filmed, & edited by: seth huot\n\nadditional filming: pat barraza, greg weaver, seth huot\n\n-Music-\nArtist: Zig Zags\nSong: Runaway\nRelease: Volcom Ent Vinyl Club #32",
