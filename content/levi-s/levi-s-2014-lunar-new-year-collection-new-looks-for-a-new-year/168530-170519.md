    "description": "The Levi's\u00ae 2014 Lunar New Year (Year of Horse) collection takes the pioneers of today on a journey that starts with the Modern Frontier, a belief that the wisdom gleaned from our past will allow for greater possibilities ahead. Be bold. Brave. Daring. \n\nThe headline 'Fortune Favors the Fearless' is a reminder to take risks, seek truth and move into the future with optimism and enthusiasm.\nSteeped in heritage and iconography, yet festive and future-forward, our Lunar New Year collection incorporates the traditional colors of the holiday: red and gold, for luck and prosperity. Design brings together a fresh mix of eclectic and iconic. Prints and scale are reworked with unconventional placement. Metallic studs shine in heritage classics. Hidden details surprise and delight; contrast comes in the form of tonal panels and embroidered embellishment. Rocker, refined.\n\nFORTUNE FAVORS THE FEARLESS. GO FORTH.",
