    "description": "There's nothing like getting up early and enjoying an early morning sunrise surf session with the Queen of Queens (Beach, that is) - Kelia Moniz (plus, we like to take advantage of an open lineup). \n\nIn episode 2, Kelia takes teammates Bruna Schmitz and Kassia Meador around to some of her local favorites including the legendary Queens Beach in Waikiki and catch a ride in their Ford Fiesta, bikinis in tow, to a local side of the island Makaha Beach -- Oahu's true playground. Enjoy this week's road tripping adventure and get inspired to try something new -- maybe even a Sup Squatch? (just watch...you'll see what we mean!). \n\nIn Kelia's words\" It's always nice to give a little piece of your heaven to your friends\".
