    "description": "Still your pounding heart, steady your busy hands and force upon yourself this opportunity to free your office-numbed mind. Let your bandy legs run from the four white walls and enjoy the wanderings of Electric's Craig Anderson, Jay Davies and Ry Craike as they guide their sleds through, over, and under some of Indonesia's multi-colored carpet rides.\n\nMusic: Spaceships by Tweak Bird.
