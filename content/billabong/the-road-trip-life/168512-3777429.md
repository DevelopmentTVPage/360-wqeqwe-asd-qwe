    "description": "You know that dream from high school? The one when you grab your best friends, get a dirty old camper, fill it with surfboards and just take off? Your only care in the world is the coast and your car, and as the days pile up so does the fun.\n\nCreed McTaggart and Dave Rastovich lived out that dream this fall. They surfed, they hiked, they fixed flat tires and sat around campfires. They stopped at funny stores in funky towns, surfed sharky coves and laughed every step of the way.\n\nIt was the epitome of the dream, complete with original music written and performed by Rasta.",
