    "description": "We packed our bags, hopped on a plane to the Land Of The Long White Cloud and hit the road. Ernest, our Kombi took us on a journey through rolling hills, fields of green, prehistoric forests filled with enormous ferns, lakes and quaint little towns. We enjoyed candy coloured sunsets and crisp offshore winds, glistening ocean water and perfect afternoon slides. There were lost of laughs, cuddles and late night girl talk - memories were made that will last a lifetime.",
