    "description": "FL\u00fcD, the New York based watch and accessories company, is proud to announce the release of their latest collaboration timepiece with lifestyle athletic brand Above The Rim (ATR). The timepiece is an interpretation of FL\u00fcD's classic PANTONE silhouette that ties nicely into ATR's current campaign entitled, \"One City at a Time.\" The watch features a cityscape and ATR logo printed on the dial, a minimalistic circular face, all pieced together by a white band. This year, the brand hosted basketball events in Seattle, Los Angeles, Houston and Puerto Rico, and produced a number of events over the summer in New York City, including the sponsorship of the L.E.S Express Basketball Tournament in Soho. The skylines of the numerous cities inspired the aesthetics of the FL\u00fcD watch.\n\nAbout FL\u00fcD: FL\u00fcD has been leisurely making the watch the ultimate accessory. Our goal is simple: to create unique, fresh accessories for the casual and street-wear enthusiast but without the pretentiousness on the price tag. Our philosophy is straightforward, the right accessory at the right price. We are committed to bringing consumers great quality and stylish timepieces for any occasion.",
