    "description": "We got the chance to surprise one lucky man with $35K! Edward was the winner of the #SpendReckless Young & Reckless\/Tilly's contest where over 150,000 people entered to win $35,000 cash. \n\nUpon receiving the money, Edward immediately bought his mother a brand new car! It was amazing to see the reactions on both sides and we're very thankful to have been a part of it.\n\nMusic:\nJay-Z - $100 Bill\nD-Why - One Day\nSkizzy Mars - Summer11\nAvicii - Speed (burn & Lotus F1 Team Mix)",
