    "description": "For Matt and Kim\u2019s latest music video, they used a wooden coat hanger, some fishing wire, and a GoPro filming 720p at 240 frames per second. The result: a circular moment frozen in time. Watch them take the rig to the stage at Governors Ball 2016 with a little help from Curt from Flosstradamus. The wire didn\u2019t hold up and we get an up-close and personal look at the NYC crowd! \n\nShot 100% on the HERO4\u00ae camera \n\nMUSIC:\nMatt and Kim - \"Please No More\" \nfrom the new EP - WE WERE THE WEIRDOS \n\nMatt and Kim's new music video, \"Let's Run Away\", shot in the same style\n\nWE WERE THE WEIRDOS",
