    "description": "Flying a wingsuit over an active volcano has long been a dream for Roberta Mancino. After years of training, she embarked on a mission to Chile's Villarrica stratovolcano to fly through the sulfur-infused smoke that pours from its crater. \n\nVillarrica proved to be the place where this dream came true. Watch as Roberta jumps from a helicopter at 15,000ft and flies her wingsuit through the volcanic smoke and turbulence above one of South America's highest active volcanoes.\n\nShot 100% on the HERO4\u00ae camera\nThis video features drone footage of Marum from \"GoPro: The Adventure in Life in 4K,\"",
