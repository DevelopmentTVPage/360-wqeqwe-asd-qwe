    "description": "Professional fun guy and videographer Noah Alani (he's Kolohe's guy) and ...Lost SurfSkate rider Juan-Pablo go on a downhill skate run in San Clemente with Noah's GoPro camera strapped to the end of a golf club. We're not sure what Noah is riding but Juan-Pablo is on his ...Lost SurfSkate pro model - the \"Blacksheep Bomber\". Juan-Pablo was also testing out his new leather suit that he is borrowing from his friend so it's not really his but he's going to use it in his race next weekend. Check the video below.",
