    "description": "What we do is what defines us\u2014or, as New York City's 3sixteen design label puts it: \"What we make is who we are.\" Combining a commitment to craftsmanship with a dedication to durability, the label\u2014which makes all of its apparel in the United States\u2014believes that all good things should look better with age, a sentiment that is equally embodied in G-SHOCK's GLS100. The GLS100's durability is unquestionable, with a Low Temperature Resistant LCD screen that can withstand conditions down to -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Its distinguished design, available with either a Ballistic Nylon or Synthetic Leather band, possesses both the presence of something old and the vibrance of something new\u2014much like the Spring Equinox itself.",
