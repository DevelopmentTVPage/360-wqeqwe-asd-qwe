    "description": "The MT-G watch is a refined, luxury G-SHOCK series crafted at Casio's Yamagata factory in Japan and is meticulously assembled from materials and components made entirely in-house. The timepiece employs G-SHOCK's advanced Core Guard Structure of stainless steel, resin and alpha Gel\u00ae to ensure mechanical integrity, coupled with LED - infused Tough Movement for ongoing precision - The MT-G is the epitome of modern wrist couture.\n\nThe Fall\/Winter 2014 partnership between Todd Snyder and G-SHOCK MT-G consists of both product design and product integration. Using the classic appeal of a gentleman's favorite leather armchair as inspiration - Todd Snyder developed a limited edition watch gift box that bears both the G-SHOCK & Todd Snyder logo. The gift box is constructed out of a black stained wood exterior and dark tan leather interior. The box will house the MTGS1000BD-1A- a version of the G-SHOCK MT-G watch that is finished in refined black Ion Plated stainless steel or the Stainless Steel version of the same model, MTGS1000D-1A. MT-G watches will be seen on the models' wrists as they walk the runway and will also be on display backstage.",
