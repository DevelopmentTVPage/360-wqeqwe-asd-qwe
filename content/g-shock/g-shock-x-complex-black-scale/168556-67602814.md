    "title": "G-SHOCK X COMPLEX : Black Scale",
    "description": "Black Scale may have been born on the West Coast, but when your fundamental aesthetic is black and white, you were made for NYC. Black Scale has had a brick and mortar presence in New York for five years now, and according to the brand\u2019s creative director, Mega, Black Scale has transformed and matured during its NYC tenure.\n\nTrends on the street will always inspire fashion, and the simple monochromatic of G-SHOCK\u2019s black & white series delivers high contrast and a look that\u2019s always on point, but New York City has a unique vertical influence, as well. We took Mega on a helicopter flight over Manhattan, so we could better appreciate the full scope, contrast and, well, scale of the city.",
