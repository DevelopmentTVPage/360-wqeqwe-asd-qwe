    "description": "It takes consummate skill to achieve maximum performance in formula drift racing. That\u2019s why G-Shock has recently partnered with Scion Racing to showcase several of their top drivers. In this edition, we interviewed Fredric Asabo who made his debut in 2008 and has been turning heads ever since. You can clearly see Asabo loves what he does and was determined at the age of 18 to be a leader in drift racing. He tells us absolute toughness is something he can really relate to on the drift course. And his G-Shock is always with him 24\/7 no matter what he\u2019s doing.\n\nA tough sport needs a tough watch and the G-Shock line of watches is the perfect complement. Check out all the latest models here and check back frequently to see up and coming events from G-Shock.",
