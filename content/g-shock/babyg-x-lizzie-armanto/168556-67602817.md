    "description": "At only 21 years old, Lizzie Armanto has spent the last 4 years dominating the women's skate scene. Lizzie is a 4x World Cup Skateboarding Champion and recent ESPN X Games Gold Medalist. After dominating women's events for the past 4 years, Lizzie spent most of 2013 competing and qualifying for finals in Men\u2019s Pro events around the world with a goal of being the first woman to finish top 3 in a Men\u2019s Pro event.\nFrom core skateboard publications around the world to features in mainstream fashion and lifestyle magazines, Lizzie is in a class of her own. With an equal amount of core media to her male counterparts, Lizzie\u2019s advantage lies in her appeal to a broader mainstream audience allowing her to transcend her sport.",
