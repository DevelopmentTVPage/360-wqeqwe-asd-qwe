    "description": "Designed for use in the most extreme environments on Earth, the G-SHOCK MUDMASTER combines a completely new mud-resistant structure with highly unique functionality to form a timepiece that is as tough as it is useful. Featuring G-SHOCK\u2019s Version 3 Triple Sensor, the MUDMASTER provides its wearer with vital survival intel, including direction, temperature and altitude. It also offers enhanced visibility with a non-reflective sapphire crystal, oversized dial, 3D index and full auto double LED lights. No wonder it is the top choice of both rangers and rescue crews alike.",
