    "description": "Alan Anderson's basketball career has been a lesson in determination\u2014and geography. Before landing with his current team, the Brooklyn Nets, the former college stand-out spent the last nine years playing for professional clubs in Italy, Russia, Croatia, Spain and Israel, not to mention several teams in the NBA d-league and the NBA itself (including Toronto, just for good measure). Having spent so much of his life traveling, Alan Anderson knows the value of having your bearings the minute your plane touches down.\n\nAnderson says that, during his first tenure overseas, he was slow to come out of his shell. But as he started to explore his surroundings, he realized that an NBA player abroad has the chance to see the \"best sides of every country, every city.\" When all was said and done, he fell in love with the weather in Israel, the team in Barcelona, and the warm support of the Croatian fans.",
