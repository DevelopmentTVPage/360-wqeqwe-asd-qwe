    "description": "\"ABSOLUTE TOUGHNESS\"\nA 10-year battery life, 10-bar water resistance and 10-meter dropping shock resistance.\nThese were the three requirements of the \"Triple 10\" concept that led to development G-SHOCK's shock-resistant structure.\nThe rugged shape and robust styling originated with an engineer's brief calling for an \"unbreakable watch\".\nSince its birth in 1983, G-SHOCK has continued its unrestrained evolution while retaining its unique basic structure.\nToday, G-SHOCKcontinues to take up challenges beyond the limits of time and common sense.",
