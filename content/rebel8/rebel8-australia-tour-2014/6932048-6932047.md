    "description": "May-June 2014. REBEL8 founder Joshy D. and legendary artist Mike Giant spread the eight in the Southern Hemisphere. First stop: Sydney. Painting, skating and inspiration. Speaking at Vivid Sydney. Seeking what\u2019s under the surface. Next up: further south to Melbourne, home of the black-clad resident. T-shirts and good times. Graphics on walls, never-ending brews, a couple of tattoos and plenty of joints. Showcasing the trademark lifestyle that\u2019s one part art genius and the other part business entrepreneur \u2013 the perfect formula for success. All in black and white, of course.",
