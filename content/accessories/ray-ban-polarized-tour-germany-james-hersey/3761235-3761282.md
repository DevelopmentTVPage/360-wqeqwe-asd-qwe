    "description": "The city of Cologne is divided by the river Rhine. You can switch sides by boat, one of the many bridges or via a cableway 40 meters high above the river. James Hersey went for the cableway and while sitting in the cabin he performed an acoustic version of his song \"Juliet\" for our camera. Enjoy the last clip of our Ray-Ban Polarized Sessions and make sure to check out more music from James Hersey",
