    "description": "The 32nd annual Burton US Open of Snowboarding presented by MINI wrapped up in Vail, Colorado, last weekend, and it did not disappoint. From snowy slopestyle finals, to a warm and sunny halfpipe finale, this year's Open was one of the best yet. Whether it was the consecutive Open wins from Jamie Anderson and Mark McMorris, Kelly Clark's record 7th US Open title, Taylor Gold representing for a young and hungry crew of pipe riders, or poached runs from some of snowboarding's legends, the riding was at an all-time high. See you next year!\n\nSong: Believe in you\nArtist: Mod Era\nAlbum: EP 1",
