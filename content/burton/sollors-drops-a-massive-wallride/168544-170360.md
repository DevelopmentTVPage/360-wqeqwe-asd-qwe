    "title": "Sollors Drops a Massive Wallride",
    "description": "You might have caught this clip in Burton Presents STREET [SNOWBOARDING] of Mark Sollors hitting this gigantic wall ride, gap over, drop, but it's worth seeing again. Part of a rare breed that rides equally well in the streets, the backcountry, and the park, Sollors is the definition of an all around rider. This urban gap stood out in his part for its sheer size, high risk, and huge mandatory drop. With a run-in on a mere smattering of snow, adjusting the approach angle was tricky, and coming in blind didn't make this any easier for Mark. A heavy dose of dedication, and a handful of tries, earned Mark this monster clip.",
