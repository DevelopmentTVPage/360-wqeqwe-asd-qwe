    "description": "If you didn't know any better (and we didn't), you'd think Monster Children was a really poorly titled horror movie (at least we did). It's not. It was, however, the third stop on the BIGFOOT and Jason Maloney's whirlwind tour of Australia -- a gallery in Darlinghurst just outside of Sydney. The two-day project at the Monster Children Gallery consisted of a Hurley art wall and culminated in a rather well-attended unveiling -- a healthy mix of friends, artists, critics, aficionados, beer, wine and a few token hipsters. Not bad for a Wednesday. Video: Riley Blakeway",
