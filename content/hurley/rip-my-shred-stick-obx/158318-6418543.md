    "description": "Our OBX event may have been one of the most fun yet, with the crew and competitors enjoying 2-3ft sheet glass. Our team of Mikey DeTemple, Mitch Abshere, Noah Snyder, Scotty Stopnik, Aamion Goodwin and Evan Slater helped all the competitors into some fun waves. In fact, the kids were surfing at such a high level, they were giving the pro team a run for their money. For instance, Kingston Haynes only started surfing a couple months ago and already has one of the best \"buddah stances\" we've seen in our time on the Shred Stick tour. \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",
