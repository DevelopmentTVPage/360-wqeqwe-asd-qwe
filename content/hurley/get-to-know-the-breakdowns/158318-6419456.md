    "description": "David Stucken and Julian Ness of the Breakdowns, ahem, break down their music and the path the band has taken from its inception back in 1999. David started the band when he was, \"an angst-ridden teenager taking punches from the world left and right. Music is what I channeled my pain and angst into and I find myself at 26-years-old doing just the same\" \u2014 and that's just a snippet of what David has to say.",
