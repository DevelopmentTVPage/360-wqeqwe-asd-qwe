    "description": "When Hurley teammates work together, magic things happen. It can be said for projects, products and, yes, surf contests. For the second year in a row, the Hurley A Team - this year consisting of Dane Zaun, Brad Ettinger, Jake Marsall and Eli Viszolay - won the ultra-fun Switchfoot Bro-Am in Encinitas. At the same event, our H20 team distributed 1000 water bottles to a crowd of 8,000+ screaming fans. That's thousands of dollars, going to cleanwater filters. Video: Tom Aiello",
