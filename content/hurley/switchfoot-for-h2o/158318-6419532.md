    "description": "Happy World Water Day. It's been 12 months since last World Water Day and we sure have been busy. Along with our friend Jon Rose at Waves For Water, we've spanned the globe helping people get access to clean water. So enjoy our H2O year in review video, helped made more enjoyable by the sounds of Switchfoot, as we recap our efforts in Liberia, Afghanistan, Indonesia, the Amazon and Haiti.",
