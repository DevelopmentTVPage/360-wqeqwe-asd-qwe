    "description": "A few things have become clear after our overnight northbound trek from Wrightsville to the Outer Banks. The RMSS crew survives off coffee, donuts, two hours of sleep and good rock'n'roll. Wiithout North Carolina's 100.7 The River and 106.9 The Fox, who knows where we would have ended up. The classic rock jams kept Evan Slater and PK singing away and busting out air guitar solos instead of falling asleep at the wheel. \n\nPhotos\/video: PK.",
