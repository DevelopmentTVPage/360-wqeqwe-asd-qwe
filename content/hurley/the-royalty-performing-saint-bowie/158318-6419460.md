    "title": "THE ROYALTY PERFORMING \"SAINT BOWIE\"",
    "description": "Hailing from El Paso, Texas we present to you -- The Royalty, a retro sounding, soulful, female led band. Back in May, the band released Lovers, their first full length studio album since signing with Victory Records. And guess what, half of the album was recorded right here in Hurley Music Studios. Their music has the kind of nostalgic feel that immediately puts us in a good mood -- that's why we were happy when they stopped by the studios to perform a few songs. Watch them make Bowie proud as they perform \"Saint Bowie\" -- a song off their new album.",
