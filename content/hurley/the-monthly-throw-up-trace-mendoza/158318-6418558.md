    "title": "THE MONTHLY THROW UP: TRACE MENDOZA",
    "description": "When people hear we've got an art department, they love dropping the name \"Trace Mendoza.\" Pff. Like we don't know Trace! But we really can't blame them: the man keeps amazing sketchbooks, makes killer zines and rad collages, is a whiz with a spray can, and can draw like nobody's business. June's TMTU features one of the most prolific, genuine, and all-around likeable artists in Orange County. Maybe the world.",
