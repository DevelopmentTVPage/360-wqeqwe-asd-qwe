    "description": "Bali has given us surfers the waves of our lives. So why not give back? Jon Rose, Waves for Water and H2O need your help to bring clean drinking water to the thousands of Balinese who need it. Through the Clean Water Courier program you can make a difference by bringing a few water filters to Indonesia (or anywhere else in the world for that matter) and passing them out to the local communities. You're still able to do what you love (surf), and help in the process.",
