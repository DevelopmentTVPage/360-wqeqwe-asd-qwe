    "description": "Hurley - Australian Open of Surfing- Day 9\nBeach Bowl final - Pedro Barros, Josh Stafford, Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist, Renton Millar, Josh Rodriguez, Rune Glifberg and Kevin Kowalksi blow-up big in the bowl final. Even contest directors agreed, it will go down as one of the great finals. Michael J. Fox wouldn't have seen this much air on his hover-board.\n\n\"I think every moment for me I was trying to step it up, just go bigger, higher, better, faster... It's my first time to Manly and it's been great. It was wonderful being right next to the beach, it's an awesome place -- you got the beach, the surf, the restaurants, everything is nice and close. It's great.\" - Barros",
