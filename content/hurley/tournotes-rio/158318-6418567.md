    "description": "Whilst in Rio we put our time to good use: we held an impromptu Rip My Shred Stick with the kids from the favelas, surfed heats, signed some autographs and had a few free surfs. Somewhere during this time, Brett Simpson got ahold of a video camera, and cinematic greatness ensued with the birth of \"Simpo Cam\": wrought with classic Simpo one liners and heckling. Yep, this edition of #TOURNOTES is pure good vibes (with cameos from Occy, Mick, Kelly and Jordy) so get into it.",
