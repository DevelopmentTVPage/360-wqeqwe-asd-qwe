    "description": "Bob's time in Santiago Chile featured some skydiving, the Yogu Yogu Mini-Megaramp Pro and plenty of fun. The contest was a unique one, with different action sports being pitted against one another. In the end, the crowd voted Bob and PLG the winners, giving skateboarding the win over BMX and FMX.
