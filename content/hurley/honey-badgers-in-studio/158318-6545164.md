    "description": "One of our favorite local bands, Honey Badgers, sits down for a chat in between recording sessions at the Hurley Studio. The group attempts to explain their quirkiness and unique blend of sound resulting from their mixed backgrounds and recent shift from garage jam seshes to full-bore recording machines. Keep an eye out for the guys' new album dropping in the next few weeks, and for more on the Honey Badgers.",
