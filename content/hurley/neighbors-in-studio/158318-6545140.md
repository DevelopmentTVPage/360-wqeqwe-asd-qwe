    "description": "The duo of Rachel and Adam Kaiser, who recently dropped their debut EP, stopped by the Hurley Studio to share how they fell in love with playing music. Whether it's Rachel's soulful, smooth voice or Adam's simultaneous drum and keyboard playing -- yes, he somehow plays the drums and keyboard at the same time -- The Neighbors have a great vibe that anyone can appreciate.",
