    "description": "Hailing from Leamington, England, Sharks has a unique, rock sound that we're all about. The group just wrapped up a tour with Social Distortion, and the band's lead singer, James, dropped by the Hurley Studio to record an acoustic rendition of their new single, \"Arcane Effigies\" (the album, Infamy, drops later this month). Enjoy.",
