    "description": "Jason Maloney knows how to paint a mural. The guy was beautifying structures back when spray paint was still legal. So what better candidate to team up with Laguna Beach High School art teacher Kerry Pellow and 30 of her students for a 60-foot, hand-painted mural at the school. No Tipsy elephants in this one, but it certainly has the Maloney thumbprint along with the thumbprints of 30 other gifted future artists.",
