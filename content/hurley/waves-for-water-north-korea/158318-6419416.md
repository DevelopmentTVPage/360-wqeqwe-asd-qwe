    "description": "At first the US and North Korea seem like two places that couldn't be more different than one another \u2014 and on most levels they are. But after watching this video, you'll see that they are the same on the most important level: the human one. Because clean water is something that we all need, and being able to help another person, or receive help from another person, is an experience we can all appreciate. Jon Rose has taken the Waves for Water to some incredible places, but trust us, this one might have the most impact.",
