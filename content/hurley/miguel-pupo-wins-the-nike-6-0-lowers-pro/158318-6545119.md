    "description": "Video highlights from Miggy's win at the ASP PRIME Nike 6.0 Lowers Pro. The 19-year-old beat San Clemente local and former World Tour surfer, Tanner Gudauskas, by .06, netting himself a $70,000 payday between the $40,000 winner's check and the trophy valued at $30,000. But it was the 6,500 points he earned with the win that the Brazilian coveted most, boosting him to No. 29 in the world, which puts him inside the cut off when the World Tour reshuffles at the season's midpoint. Said Miggy: \"I'm just so happy. I was thinking just about the points when I first got here, and this is great to win this event going into the next PRIME in Brazil. It's my dream to make the World Tour and these points will help.\" Video: Tom Aiello",
