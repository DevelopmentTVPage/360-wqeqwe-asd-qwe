    "description": "Every year the ASP Awards Banquet gets the world's best surfers together and has them looking their best (suits! dresses! ties! heels!). We threw our team on a big bus, made them walk the red carpet (some more begrudgingly than others, we're lookin' at you John John), and then proceeded to have a ball. Congrats to Ace, Carissa, Lakey, and John John who all took home awards. We'll be back with another #tournotes, your unique perspective into life on tour, this week from Snapper!",
