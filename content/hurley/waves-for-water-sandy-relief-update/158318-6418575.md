    "title": "WAVES FOR WATER: SANDY RELIEF UPDATE",
    "description": "It's been a long six months since Hurricane Sandy has made landfall; the relief efforts are still going, and going strong thanks to Jon Rose and Waves for Water. Press play to relive one man's account of the storm and to see how Jon, along with locals, are rebuilding homes and lives on the east coast. One small way to help is with a purchase of one of our Hurricane Sandy tees at hurley.com. All proceeds from these shirts go towards Jon and his relief initiative.",
