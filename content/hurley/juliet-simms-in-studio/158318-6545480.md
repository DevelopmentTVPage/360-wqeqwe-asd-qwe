    "description": "The singer\/songwriter who, has to this point, fronted Automatic Loveletter, recently recorded her debut solo album at the Hurley Studio. Before hitting the road for Warped Tour, Juliet was cool enough to give us a sit down, talk about making the album, why she's losing sleep waiting for it to drop performing and giving songwriting lessons at Warped Tour (among other things).
