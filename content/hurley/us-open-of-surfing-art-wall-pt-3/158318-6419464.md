    "description": "The surf might be over, the jerseys dry, the trophies on the mantle pieces and the US Open of Surfing mostly done and over with -- but the art created on the Art Wall at the US Open of Surfing will continue to live on. Everyday we've been giving out pieces of the wall printed onto Hurley boardshorts and Converse shoes -- and today we've upped the anty. The winners selected from todays Art Wall posts will win an actual chunk of the canvas, how cool is that! This video takes a look at the latter half of the collaborative creation, we like to call the art wall. It's fun, creative and inspiring art that will be living on beyond the US Open. Video: YB",
