    "description": "MonoMood hails from San Diego with influences like Modest Mouse and Red Hot Chilli Peppers, so we were pretty much sold on them before even hearing them. But once we took a listen when they won Carlsbad's Battle of the Bands we were really sold! So sold, in fact, that we invited them into our studio for the day to record and hang out. Press play to become acquainted with MonoMood.",
