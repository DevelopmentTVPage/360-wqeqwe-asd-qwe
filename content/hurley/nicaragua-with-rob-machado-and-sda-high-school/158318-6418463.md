    "description": "Rob Machado and San Dieguito Academy surf team just got back from an epic trip to Nicaragua, not just bringing their boards, but also bringing filters with them to educate the public on clean water. The team worked with Rob to train local leaders and public about how the filters worked, doing three missions to a small village, a medical clinic, as well as a school. All and all it was a successful trip, with clean water being provided for over five thousand people.",
