    "description": "Our RMSS stop in Narragansett, RI was a huge success. We were greeted with 3-4ft incredibly fun waves and our crew of Noah Snyder, Mike Detemple, Ashler Nolan, and Andrew Gesler were excited to get the kids out in the water. Despite the rainy conditions, about 70 kids came out, with their families cheering them on from the beach. Between the great surf, dance offs, and even a donut eating contest there was never a dull moment in Narragansett. \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",
