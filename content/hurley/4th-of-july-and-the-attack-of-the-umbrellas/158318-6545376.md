    "description": "The 4th of July is a rascally friend. Anticipation builds as it approaches, only to have it whirl by in a blur of illegal pyrotechnics and patriotic-fueled revelry. We're left sandy, sunburned and wondering where the day went. Relive the fun with this video documenting the red, white and blue Hurley umbrella attack that took over all of southern California.",
