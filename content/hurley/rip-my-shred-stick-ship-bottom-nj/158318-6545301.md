    "description": "The RMSS Tour's last stop just landed in Ship Bottom, New Jersey. The contest was graced with fun two-to-three foot peaks throughout the day, and we saw some crazy wipeouts, great turns, cannonballs and even a disco dance routine into the shorebreak.There were also many first-time surfers -- one of which even made the final -- who left the beach with huge smiles and something they can remember for the rest of their life. Mother nature also cooperated for us today. Just as the final finished, ominous dark clouds moved in and unleashed some heavy rainfall. Talk about great timing. Be sure to check out the video and photos from the day's action. \n\nPhotos\/video: PK.",
