    "description": "The RMSS Tour just landed on the Jersey Shore. Sea Isle, the quaint beach town by day, and not so quaint party town by night, hosted the event, which saw 45 kids show up for some fun in the surf. There was some serious shredding going on in the biggest waves we have seen up to this point on tour. Local favorite, Cassidy McClain, was the standout of the day and ended up taking top honors. There was also a huge crowd on the beach cheering and hooting after each surfer's ride. It was definitely a day to remember. But, the one bummer -- no Snookie sighting. Actually, now that we think about it, that might have been a good thing. \n\nPhotos\/video: PK.",
