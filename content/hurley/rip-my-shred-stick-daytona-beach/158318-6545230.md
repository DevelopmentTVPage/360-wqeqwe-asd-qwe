    "description": "The world's most famous beach just hosted the fifth stop of the RMSS Tour. The contest filled up to capacity by early morning with 70 groms eager to get the day started. Rob Machado and local hero Asher Nolan joined the other Hurley pros to help push the mini groms into waves and also hopped on some boards to showcase their talent for the kids and spectators. As per usual with RMSS events, there were some crazy headstands, the occasional dance move, coffin rides and party waves galore.
