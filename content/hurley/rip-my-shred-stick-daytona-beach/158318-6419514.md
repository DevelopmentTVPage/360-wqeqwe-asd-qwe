    "description": "A strong windswell and some tricky conditions met today's 70 competitors at the Daytona Beach Pier for some more RMSS good times and surf action. With the help of Beau Foster, Michael Dunphy, Brian Toth, Mikey DeTemple and Asher Nolan, all the kids were assisted into the best waves they could find and battled it out to see who could have the most fun while riding a surfboard. In the end it was Chase Elmore's mix of progressive moves (he stuck one of the better airs we've seen thus far) and big smiles that earned him the win. For his efforts, Chase took home a new pair of Phantom Create boardshorts, a GoPro camera, Spy sunglasses, Stance Socks, Freestyle gear and Futures Fins -- quite the prize pack.",
