    "description": "The RMMS Tour stopped Sunday in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Provided with a little bump in swell overnight, the groms took complete advantage of the waves on offer. There was tons of talent out in the water as Cocoa Beach's next generation of young rippers invented some crazy, new maneuvers \u2014 like the never-before-seen triple soft top transfer to belly flop. The kids were also being rewarded with valuable bonus points if they could run over Hurley's Noah Synder and Rob Machado. \n\nVideo: PK",
