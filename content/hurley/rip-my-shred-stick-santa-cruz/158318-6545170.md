    "description": "The Rip My Shred Stick Tour, led by Captain Phantom and his trusty sidekick Jorge, has travelled 10,000 miles throughout the country and has officially landed in (the unofficial) Surf City USA -- Santa Cruz, CA. This morning's event at 26th Ave was graced with the best waves of the tour thus far. We saw everything from kids busting superman airs to black labradors taking down groms brave enough to charge the inside shorebreak.
