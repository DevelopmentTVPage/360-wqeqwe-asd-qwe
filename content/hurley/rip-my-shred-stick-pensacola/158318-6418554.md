    "description": "RMSS stop number 3 on the East Coast went down yesterday at Pensacola Beach, FL. About 75 frothing kids showed up to participate, despite the extremely marginal surf on offer. The waves were in the 0-.5' range, making the INT Softboards and Riviera SUP's the equipment of choice for the majority of attendees. Team riders Mason Barns, AJ Collins, Taylor Pai, Jack MacGuire, Noah Snyder, and East Coast team manager superstar Asher Nolan came with us to help the kids into the ankle high rollers. Even with minimal surf, Nat Young impersonator Nat Write charged into the shore break a la Punker Pat and won himself the HI-Chew Wipeout of the day award. RMSS veteran Victoria Covey won the event, winning herself a new GoPro Hero 3.  \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",
