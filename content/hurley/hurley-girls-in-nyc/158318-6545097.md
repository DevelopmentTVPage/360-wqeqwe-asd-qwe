    "description": "Think New York is a bunch of people dressed in expensive clothes, crazy taxi drivers and really good bagels? Well, you'd be right, but it's also home to a super stoked surf scene (proof: we saw Lost Atlas in a packed theater full of hoots and hollers in Greenwich Village). Alongside the surf scene the streets are teeming with the gritty inspiration that keeps us excited and inspired. And since Hurley girls live in a headspace that can only be described as \"beach meets street\" there really was no better place to pass out free Hurley shirts than New York City. Press play to see how Hurley girls do Central Park and get your Surf America shirts here.",
