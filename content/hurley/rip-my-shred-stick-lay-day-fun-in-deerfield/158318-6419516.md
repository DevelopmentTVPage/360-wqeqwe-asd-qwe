    "description": "Beau Foster, Brian Toth, Mikey DeTemple, Asher Nolan, Noah Snyder and the rest of the RMSS crew met up with Cheyne Cottrel and the Flegel groms for some wake surfing and other shenanigans at a private lake in the South Florida area. With the Hurley pros trying to keep up with Noah and Keenan Flegel's skills behind the boat, it made for some embarrassing and funny moments. Thanks to Cheyne and the Flegels for their hospitality and for showing us how it's really done. \n\nVideo: PK",
