    "description": "Captain Phantom (aka Zach Hartley) has been crashing Surf PE classes up and down the Southern California coast with a van full of new Hurley Surfboards to pass out for kids to demo. Monday morning, he was at it again. Said the Cap'n: \"We just wrapped up another great Surf Demo with 25+ kids from Carlsbad High School. When we rolled into the parking lot at Tamarack on Monday morning almost all the kids in the class were already suited up, waiting to demo the boards. Everyone was all smiles, and there seemed to be lots of interest around the boards (from kids and parents). The entire Surf PE class left the beach wearing their new Hurley beanies, and as we were about to leave, the whole group yelled, 'Thank You!' Really amazing stuff.\" Video: PK",
