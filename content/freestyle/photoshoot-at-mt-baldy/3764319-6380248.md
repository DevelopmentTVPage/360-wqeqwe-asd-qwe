    "description": "Had a Photoshoot planned at Mt. Baldy on some specially built features for the Fall Catalog over spring break. On that day a random one day storm came that dropped over 6 inches of snow and brought 60 mph winds. Needless to say, we couldn't do what we had planned to do.\nNone the less, with comped tickets for the day, thanks to Mendy Cox of Mt. Baldy, we still went up and got creative in order to get what we needed. On staff photographer Nick Meistrell was able to capture some rad photos none the less and the day turned out to be a success. Here is the documentation of most of that day.\n\nRiders: Nick Rockwood, Barrington Burke, John Gaffney, and Davis Paul\nFilm: Chad LaBass and Davis Paul\nPhoto: Nick Meistrell\nEdit: Davis Paul\nSong: Jason Mraz - Dynamo of Volition",
