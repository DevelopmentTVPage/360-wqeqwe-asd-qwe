The Shark Leash comes loaded with standard digital features like time, date, stopwatch, countdown timer, alarm and night vision back-light. Like all Freestyle Watches, The Shark Leash is water resistant to 100 Meters and backed by our limited lifetime warranty. Shark to the Future! #oftencopiedneverduplicated",
