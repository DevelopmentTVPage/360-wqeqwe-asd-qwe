    "description": "In this epic saga we follow Paul Machnau, Canadian rail destroyer and cornerstone to the Dakine skateboard team. Given one week by our crackpot mad scientist to deliver the only two packs in existence to Thrasher, we watch as Paul and other Dakine athletes follow a trail of near misses throughout Portland and San Francisco. The team skates and destroys everything in their path and hits a few legendary spots along the way. Will Paul and the boys make it in time? Watch and find out.",
