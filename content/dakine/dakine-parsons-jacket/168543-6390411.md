    "title": "Dakine Parsons Jacket",
    "description": "Constructed from 2L GORE-TEX, with 40g of insulation in the body, this jacket was made for the coldest and deepest days of winter. An arsenal of features including a Napoleon media pocket, two-way venting, fully taped seams, and collar venting make the Parson's a no-brainer for mid-winter missions.",
