    "description": "The Dirksen Derby happened this weekend, and it ruled. Over 300 boarders - including northwest locals, top pros and legends - gathered at Mt. Bachelor to try their hand at Dirksen's hand built course. The event is a fundraiser for Tyler Eklund who was paralyzed snowboarding six years ago. Words can't describe how awesome this event is - snowboarding needs more of this! Check out some of the boarding that went down and make sure you come out next year.",
