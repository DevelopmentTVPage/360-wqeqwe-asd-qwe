    "description": "A few months back, we tried to shoot Shawn's Ad Day. After a long day, several spots and no ad we finally had to call it. Flash forward, Shawn and the boys are at it again. This time we hit several spots in Costa Mesa and Dana Point, nailing the Ad after putting in some work, as the sun was\nsetting on the Pacific ocean.",
