    "title": "Compatibility Test: Channel Boards and Non-Burton Bindings",
    "description": "There are a lot of misconceptions in snowboarding, ranging from whether or not one can ride switch on a directional board, to the fact that there are two pros named Jeremy Jones. But we can at least dispel one rumor for you: non-Burton bindings do indeed fit on a Burton board featuring The Channel. While it's true that when The Channel first released it only worked with Burton bindings, recent developments have opened up the versatility, adjustability, and convenience of The Channel to other binding brands as well.\n\nWith the help of a couple Burton Knowbuddies: Brady Lem and Tommy Gesme, and the trusty Burton Demo Center employees: Connor Manning and Dave Massie, we set out to prove once and for all that The Channel works with just about any binding out there.",
