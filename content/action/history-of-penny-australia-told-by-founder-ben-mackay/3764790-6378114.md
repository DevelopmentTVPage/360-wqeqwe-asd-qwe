    "description": "Ben Mackay discovered skateboarding at the age of five, when his dad bought him a second-hand plastic skateboard from a yard sale. Before long, he was skating all over the neighborhood, describing the feeling as terrifying, exhilarating, and above all, bliss. \n\nAlmost thirty years after discovering that little plastic board, Ben founded Penny Skateboards. Since 2010, the brand has grown to lead the plastic skateboard market, with Penny boards now sold all over the world.",
