    "description": "It started in 1994 by a group of skateboarders with a viewpoint that was nearly unheard of at the time -that skate shoes should be designed with skateboarder's needs in mind. From there, the spark of innovation caught fire and led to a revolution in skateboard footwear and apparel. For 20 years prior, and for 20 years ahead, DC's dedication to progression inspires people around the world to DEFY CONVENTION.",
