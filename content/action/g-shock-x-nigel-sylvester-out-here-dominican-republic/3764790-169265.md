    "title": "G-Shock x Nigel Sylvester: \"Out Here\" - Dominican Republic",
    "description": "The Dominican Republic sounds like one of the most unlikely places you would think to travel to for a BMX trip but Nigel Sylvester and G-Shock prove it to be a undiscovered gem in their first visual release of 2012. Between all the hustle and bustle, crowded city streets, DR offers incredible riding spots and energy which Nigel uses as fuel to handle his bike in a form and fashion that only he knows how to.",
