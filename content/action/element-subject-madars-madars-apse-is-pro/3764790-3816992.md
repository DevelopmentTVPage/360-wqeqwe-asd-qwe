    "description": "We proudly welcome Madars Apse to the Pro team.\n\nIt's impossible not to get entranced by the creative skateboarding of this lanky, Latvian. The world-traveling Madars speaks five languages, is university educated, and is endless fun to be around. His grace on board is not always mirrored off it; he can be quite clumsy \u2013 but lovably so. Madars finds friends and adventure wherever wheels and whims take him. If you come across this tall, blond ripper carrying a skateboard and a banjo in some far off land, you're in for memorable time.",
