    "description": "Washington native Alicia Fillback clocks fly time and gnar points every single day. As one of the hardest working females in downhill skateboarding she\u2019s refined a freeride style all her own that mixes technical sliding, power, and a level head when stakes are high. Typically used to riding her Backlash 37 on the urban landscapes of Portland and San Francisco, this time she tackles the big mountains of Southern California.\n  \nFilm\/Edit: Jack Boston\n \nRider: Alicia Fillback",
