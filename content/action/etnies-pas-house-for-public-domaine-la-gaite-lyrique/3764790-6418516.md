    "description": "Imagine a city of the future where skateboards are used as the primary form of transportation and recreation \u2013 in and out of your home. A utopia city for skateboarders would mean that a skateable path, like a ribbon connecting everything together, links each building in an unending ability to keep in motion on your board. The PAS House takes this concept and brings it to life through an architectural project mixing a modern single family home with a skateboard ramp structure \u2013 all from an environmentally-driven perspective.",
