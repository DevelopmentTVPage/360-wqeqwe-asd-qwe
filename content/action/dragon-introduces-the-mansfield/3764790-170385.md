    "description": "A modern classic with frameless design.\n\nRevamping a classic style to create its newest frame, Dragon has released the Mansfield--a new offering for spring 2013 that fuses modern simplicity with a timeless silhouette. \n\nDesigned for bold individuals with stylish tendencies, the Mansfield goes from beach to street with flawless transitions. Largely inspired by major Hollywood sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, this sunglass is a new favorite for Dragon surf athletes Evan Geiselman and Beau Foster.\n\n\"These shades are perfect for cruising around town,\" says Evan Geiselman. \"They look good, are crazy lightweight and are one of the most stylish frames I've ever seen.\" \n\nCheck the latest video and see the Mansfield in it's element.",
