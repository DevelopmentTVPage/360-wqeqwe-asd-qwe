    "description": "Element presents \"A few days in Boston\", a video project featuring Element riders Nick Garcia, Dominick Walker and Brandon Westgate. \n\nThe reigning title-holder for the term East Coast Powerhouse, is without a doubt Brandon Westgate; he\u2019s truly in a class of his own. While power, pop, and innovation define his skateboarding, you won\u2019t find ego or bravado cluttering his success. His footage conveys a mastery of the urban jungles but he calls the sleepy town of Carver, Massachusetts home. His New England upbringing shaped his character, which is defined an admirable work ethic, and a no bullshit attitude. \n\nWhen other pros hit the bar after the session, Westgate heads to his wood shop to build bins for the cranberries he grows and harvests with his family. Solid skateboarder, solid man. \n\nThe Brandon Westgate collection now available",
