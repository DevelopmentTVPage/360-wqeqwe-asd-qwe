    "description": "Dragon Launches Summer Webisode Series Frame of Mind\n\nCarlsbad, Calif. (June 5, 2012) - Dragon releases the first of a four-part webisode series called Frame of Mind: The B-Sides of Life, featuring Mick Fanning, Evan Geiselman, Owen Wright, and Rob Machado. This video collection of short stories is a view into the different sides of the surfer's personalities, more specifically, what inspires them in and out of the water.\n\nBy definition, Frame of Mind is described as \"the disposition of one's inner thoughts.\" This series of webisodes focuses in on the seldom seen personas behind some of surfing's biggest names. It will be told online starting June 5 at DragonAlliance.com , when the first installment of Dragon's Frame of Mind goes live on the Web. In the first episode, titled \"The Escape\", Mick Fanning talks about how the real stoke in surfing is in escaping with his friends to surf perfect waves without the pro surfing circus.\n\nThe rest of the series will be hitting the web throughout the summer with fresh, original edits and entertaining stories about some of the coolest surfers on the planet.",
