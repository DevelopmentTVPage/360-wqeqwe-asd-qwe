    "description": "The inaugural SPY Del Moto Derby Invitational brought a new type of horsepower to the Del Mar Fairgrounds on Sunday, June 17, marking the very first motocross race in San Diego County Fair history. Held inside the Del Mar Arena, riders were challenged by berms, whoops, tables and double kickers fit for any pro level race. Showcasing amateur and professional arena-style motocross racing in 450cc and 250cc classes, as well as 65cc and 85cc for young riders, the Del Moto Derby delivered an event the Southern California motocross community has long-awaited.\n\nHometown hero, and seven-time AMA Supercross Champion, Jeremy McGrath, treated the crowd to his famous tail whips during an expression session stacked with top pro riders. McGrath was joined in the exhibition by his fellow SPY teammate Grant Langston, who celebrated his 30th birthday at the race and went on to place third in the Pro Division. Aside from world-class racing, fans happily lined up for an autograph signing with motocross legend Kevin Windham and riders from SPY's motocross team.\n\nPartnering once more with Be The Match\u2014a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing bone marrow transplants\u2014SPY donated all rider $30 entry fees, plus an additional $2,400 to the organization, totaling $4,800.\n\nRESULTS:\n\n65 Open\n1.
