    "description": "The second Arnette Street Fighter II Tourney and Skate Jam hosted by Willy Santos was an all around blast and a lot of fun. The event kicked off with DJ Kreese (facebook.com\/deejaykreese) spinning his beats as Willy and local skaters displayed their skills to start off the skate jam that went off for a few hours. \nThanks to Wahoos Fish Tacos and Huberts Lemonade, everyone had great food and drink to dig into while enjoying their time. \nLater in the evening, everyone gathered around the Street Fighter II arcade in the retail store and watched the battle playout. The last fighter standing won the limited edition Arnette Slayer Witch Doctor & Skylight snow goggle and an Arnette backpack filled with goodies!",
