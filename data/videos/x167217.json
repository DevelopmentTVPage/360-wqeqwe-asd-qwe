    "description": "Zack Warden hails from St. Louis, Missouri but now spends his time training at Woodward West. Over the last five years Zack has proven to be a heavy hitter at contests with some pretty insane tricks. He was the first ever to land a bikeflip backflip, and recently won gold at X-Games Brazil with this trick. Always progressing, he is now throwing down a bikeflip backflip but adding a tailwhip just cause he can.\n\nFilmed by:\nVeesh\nDylan Pfhol\n\nEdited by:\nVeesh\n\nMusic by:\nPianos Become The Teeth\n\"I'll Get By\"\nThe Lack Long After\ntopshelfrecords.com\npianosbecometheteeth.com\n\nBe sure to check our We Live blog for more Zack\nhttp:\/\/www.foxhead.com\/welive",
