    "description": "Big shout out to Evan Geiselman for taking home the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing Rookie of the Year Title. His first North Shore campaign sure was a good one -- a quarterfinal finish at Haleiwa and a top 32 finish out of a 128-man field at the Sunset Pro. Well done, EG!! \nVideo: Tom Aiello",
