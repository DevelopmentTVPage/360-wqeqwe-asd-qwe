    "title": "SPY Presents The Journey | Adam Bickett",
    "description": "For 10 years, Adam Bickett has been on an unrelenting search for adventure, personal fulfillment, and happiness. In the process, he has become one of the top ultra-cyclists in the world. A full-time software engineer by day, Adam is compelled to blow past limits and redefine his understanding of what's possible through the sport of ultra-distance cycling.\n\nThe Journey is a moving portrayal of Adam Bickett\u2019s experience during the 2014 Race Across the West (RAW). Ride along with Bickett as he pushes through 880 miles, a fractured L1 vertebra, 3 state lines, multiple mountain ranges and 2 virtually sleepless nights en route from Oceanside, California to Durango, Colorado in the heart of the Rockies. In The Journey, Adam finds purpose in following his passion, and seeks to inspire others to chase their own dreams. \n\nFor more about information about SPY, log-on at www.spyoptic.com",
