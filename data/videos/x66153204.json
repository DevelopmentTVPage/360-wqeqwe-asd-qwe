    "transcripts": "So the first memory I have of the TCT event is I was running and I mean it was just me I'd show up in my 10 by 10 have guys help me pop it up we'd have like someone help with the little table, so we got donuts brought donuts there it was very raw. I mean it was it wasn't even like there was no thought process behind it, the only thought was get to the beach have the tent and we're running heat and someones gonna win. You know the goal I guess underlining goal it wasn't meant to be was that it was this kind of the fun side of surf events that don't happen, you know it's the anti-contest you can say. I still think that heritage and the roots of these events going back to uh you know that family-style home-grown almost anti contest feel it's still there, as far as like the competitiveness of um amateur surfing now, um so much more elevated with the TCT we've really understood that and known that to the point where we've grown with the progression of the sport and the progression of the kids um to elevate and highlight what's happening around us and still keep that old school flavor of just complete fun.",
