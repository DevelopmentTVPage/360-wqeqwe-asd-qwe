Once everyone checked in and received their custom O'Neill 24\/7 race jerseys they made their way to the lake and started to warm up. It was quite a spectacle to see 160 eager racers lined up at the start with blue skies and Snow-capped mountains on the horizon. Once the line was set, the horn blew and the 5 mile race around Donner Lake was on.",
