What's wrong with this haha, Kaycee you should grab that one. I think we definitely have enough for pie, what a success. Alright ready to start baking? Yeah! Haha alright so what do we need for the crust? For the crust we're going to get our flour, sugar, salt, measurement spoon, these bowls and bake the biggest bowl. Alright with two and a half cups of flour, we're gonna mix it with a tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and two sticks of the butter.  We gotta go at it to cut up the butter. Oh yeah, haha do you want to wash the strawberries? Yes, perfect. Your hands gets tired after a while, baking's a work out. Let's get this dough ready, here we go let's make it look pretty. For the filling we're going to use about one-third cup of flour, 1 cup of sugar, one lemon, and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix it all together. OK ready to pour it in? Haha what we do know is we take these two and put it like right in the middle going this way,  yeah get the shortest one going, beauty! Ready to put it in?Yeah, ok yeah and now we wait. All done! [Laughter] Alright ready to start baking? Yeah, that was I can hear that was the worst high five ever! Do it again, alright. Alright you ready to start baking? Yeah! Haha.
