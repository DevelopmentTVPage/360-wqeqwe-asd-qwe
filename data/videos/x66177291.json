    "transcripts": "Long ago, there was nothing. No sand, rivers, or sea, the evil frozen troll Ymir came to be, and an epic battle followed between. He and the mightiest of all gods... Odin, Odin led his brothers through a grueling war to the death of Ymir. To ensure their victory, they scattered the troll's remains to create the world. His bones became the mountains, and his fragments became the rocks and pebbles of the shore. They pushed the Earth aside into rolling hills, leaving gullies and canyons into which Ymir's blood flowed to form the rivers, lakes, and seas. Though that battle ended long ago, the vast world it created will always echo. The primal questions of man: How far can I go? How hard can I fight?",
