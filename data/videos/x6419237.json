    "title": "Converse CONS Space 002 BLN: Skate on Art",
    "description": "For a two week period in October, Converse took over three floors of an abandoned textile factory to create the second CONS Space with skaters, sculptors and live-in artists.\n\nThe ground floor Skate Lab featured sculptures designed by Roberto Cuellar, who took textural design influence from the former use of the space. These sculptures have been created as artwork being fully skateable obstacles at the same time. By using special filming techniques and unusual shooting angles a team of local Converse riders is referencing the unique work of Roberto with this skate edit. \n\nMusic: Hidden Orchestra \"Fourth Wall\"",
