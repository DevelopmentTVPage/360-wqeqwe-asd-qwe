    "description": "Here along the SoCal coast, we know a thing or two about beaches, sunshine and miles of smooth concrete, but we also know it ain't that easy for a lot of our skateboard brethren. That's why we ventured over to Finland with the Makia crew for a taste of their Scandinavian Spring blend - equal parts urban lifestyle, countryside spirit and gratefulness for the end of another harsh winter. There in the beautifully rugged coastal landscape, we found inspiration for basic layers, warm fleece and sturdy construction. Don Brown and Natas Kaupas, on the other hand, found a playground on the seemingly unskateable rocks of the Finnish archipelago. We camped; we saw; we conquered. The result is our Spring 2013 Makia & etnies Collection.",
