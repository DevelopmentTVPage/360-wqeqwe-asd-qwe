    "description": "Snowboarder Magazine holds a Superpark every year at a chosen resort. Fortunately my home mountain, Mt. Bachelor, has been chosen the last 3 years to host this awesome event. During the week, 5 terrain park crews from around the U.S. come and build unique features in designated areas near the Sunrise Lift chair area to show their snow sculpting skills. Over 300 professional snowboarders are invited. Also, 12 different industry brands ranging from Burton Snowboards to Volcom clothes are invited to hire a camera crew to shoot the event, make an edit, and share it for a contest called \"The Battle Of The Brands.\" If you win? An all expense paid trip to Cabo San Lucas for the videographers, snowboarders, and team manager involved in the edit. I was hired by Dakine to shoot and edit their BOTB video. Here is the edit made possible by all their riders, Ike Smith on camera, Tom Teller on graphics, and Scotty Conerly, the team manager.",
