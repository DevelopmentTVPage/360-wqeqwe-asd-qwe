    "description": "A lack of rideable surf didn't stop our 80 competitors from having the most fun they possibly could have during today's RMSS stop in Deerfield Beach, Florida. And although you wouldn't think it, the flat conditions made for some of the most creative surfing the tour has ever seen -- everything from chair rides, to cartwheels, to 15-second-long headstands. The judges had their had their hands full with all the great action in the water, but in the end it was little Jordan Rosenholtz taking home the win and Jack Koras coming in a close second (side note: for both Jordan and Jack, it was their first time on a surfboard -- very impressive). A big thanks goes out to Cheyne Cottrell and the crew from Island Water Sports for helping us dodge the golf-ball-sized hail during the afternoon slideshow and retail event and also for their huge help in the morning's surf contest.  \n\nVideo: PK",
