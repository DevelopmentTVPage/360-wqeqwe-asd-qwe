    "description": "The New Highway Hymnal were hand selected by Deafheaven to open for them on the Boston stop of their recent Rubber Tracks Live tour. We sat down with the Rubber Tracks alumni to uncover the journey of their noise-pop sound from basement shows to the studio to the stage.\n\nThis Haverhill-born four piece lays out droning, experimental noise-pop. In February 2012 the band released their debut 7-inch, \u201cBlackened Hands\u201d off Boston label Vanya Records (Bearstronaut, Andre Obin), and began making themselves known in Boston for their intense live show, which translated well to both the area\u2019s established music venues and basement\/DIY spaces. The New Highway Hymnal are Amelia Gormley on bass and vocals, Travis Hagan on drums, Charlie Northern on guitar and vocals, and Hadden Stemp on vocals and guitar.",
