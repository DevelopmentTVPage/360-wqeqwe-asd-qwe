Woah, wow front slide air around the corner bottoming out, little victory wave, he's got a sense of humor about it all. Coming out backwards, woah let's twist, wow that was a huge one, solid. Lance is mixing it up, that's front side 5 0 from Lance. Great invert, Lance came up with the names for half of these tricks, that's right. So cool to hear the stories of him and Neal Blender and hawk inviting all the stuff. Absolutely, look at that, Woah, the push carved! That uh just the excitement of that alone might of bumped his score just by a point or two. That you know the push carved is so hard and grosso is kissing him! And he kind of like over rotated, but managed to hang on and didn't take a slam that man Lance has got to be feeling good right now. [Music Playing].",
