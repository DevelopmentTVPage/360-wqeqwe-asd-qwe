    "description": "The Element Make It Count 2014 tour trucked on through the Midwest and into Detroit for an event at Modern Skate Park. Skaters came from all over to compete for an experience of a lifetime: a trip to the finals at The Berrics, Element Skate Camp, and a shot at an Element sponsorship! The level of skateboarding was truly amazing; Eric Roennecke was cruising the park with endless lines of pure style, while Dave Dixon stomped bangers left and right. But no one could touch the hammers that Detroit Local Dustin Blauvelt brought to the table, and he wound up taking home first place and a trip to the finals once again. Thank you to everyone who came out to skate with us, and a special thanks to Modern Skate Park... We'll see you at the next stop!",
