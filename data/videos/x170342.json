    "description": "On Stage 5 of the 2014 Absa Cape Epic in South Africa, at the summit of a 15km-long, rutted trail full of boulders, in the middle of nowhere, riders were met with the Oakley Medusa; an opera singer with a 10m-tall dress forged out of metal, fabric and madness and wearing the iconic Oakley Medusa headpiece.\n\nHer anthemic arias boomed throughout the valley and 1200 competitors summited one of the hardest inclines to the sound of her song. Weird, unexpected and, disruptive by design.\n\n\n\n\nSoprano: Juliana Venter singing One Fine Day, Madame Butterfly (Act 2) - Puccini",
