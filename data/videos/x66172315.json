When we were on like hard times he always was like, \"I'll sell the 'vette, I'll sell it.\" I'm like, \"No you love that car, you can't sell it.\" So one year, I got the car completely fixed, and refurbished, and everything. What is the best gift you've ever received? When I was probably around like 14, my ex-boyfriend who did not have a lot of money, he made me a card cause he couldn't afford to buy me one. It was so sweet and it meant so much to me, that, I still have the card to this day. So what's the worst gift you've ever received? My grandmother bought me these ugly shoes, but I love my grandmother so much. They had like this big ol' bow, black bow. I'm sorry grandma, I love you, but they weren't cute. [Music Playing]",
