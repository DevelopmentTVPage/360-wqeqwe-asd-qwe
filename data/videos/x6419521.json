    "description": "It seems like a long time ago now, but once upon a time, we went to a magical land called Dallas, Texas for a magical gathering called the Student Television Network. There we met a bunch of magical students who specialize in the magic of film \u2014 we asked them to create commercials about either the Krush n Only or the Nfinitee. And for the last few weeks we've showcased our personal favorites \u2014 but today we're showing you the video we thought was the best of the best. It's brought to you by Coppell High School and not only does it show off our favorite new tee, the Nfinitee, it's creative, imaginative and an all around fun video to watch. Congrats, Coppell and thanks for the rad homage to the Nfinitee!",
