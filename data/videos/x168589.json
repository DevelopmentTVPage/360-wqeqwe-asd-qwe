    "description": "Strada Customs is an NYC-based bicycle company dedicated to the idea that every rider deserves a bike made to his or her own specs. Using a base of chromoly steel, and only high-end components, the company has built some of the flashiest, and most durable, bikes on New York City streets today. The G-Shock 30th anniversary custom fixed-gear bicycle features Eric HAZE's anniversary logo, the \"absolute toughness\" motto on both wheels, red aluminum alloy accents, and all the style and ruggedness that we associate with the G-Shock DW6900MF-1, DW6900MF-2, and DW6900MF-4 watches",
