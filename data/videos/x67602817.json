    "description": "At only 21 years old, Lizzie Armanto has spent the last 4 years dominating the women's skate scene. Lizzie is a 4x World Cup Skateboarding Champion and recent ESPN X Games Gold Medalist. After dominating women's events for the past 4 years, Lizzie spent most of 2013 competing and qualifying for finals in Men\u2019s Pro events around the world with a goal of being the first woman to finish top 3 in a Men\u2019s Pro event.\nFrom core skateboard publications around the world to features in mainstream fashion and lifestyle magazines, Lizzie is in a class of her own. With an equal amount of core media to her male counterparts, Lizzie\u2019s advantage lies in her appeal to a broader mainstream audience allowing her to transcend her sport.",

    "transcripts": "Los Angeles is really cool because there's the beach, there's downtown, there's like Venice and it's like kind of artsy and then up the coast when you go like head towards Malibu just beach and it's like a cool space to just think and get away from the city part of it but then the city's fun to go to because it's like hectic and there's like so much going on. I feel really fortunate that I get to skateboard for a living. I go around the world, it's just unreal. I think society sees me as like I'm a weirdo, an outcast, but I don't know from my perspective everyone else is crazy. I don't know they just so many that haven't given up on the idea of whatever they wanted to do in the first place. Go roll around on the concrete and work at something for a long time until it works out and makes a whole other part of skateboarding really slam worth it.  When I'm home I end up driving a lot and it's like one of the few times I get to be by myself and I just blast music and kind of zone out. I think I keep to myself a lot, creativity to me is doing things your own way and skating like it's not about what you do necessary all the time but it's how I do it. Maybe a foot or specific little details about how you set up, put your own twist on things. I do, I love my life, but I don't like want to sound like I'm bragging about it. I'm Lizzie Armanto, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Santa Monica, California.",
