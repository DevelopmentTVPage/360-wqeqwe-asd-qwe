    "transcripts": "Hey I'm Jess Paul right now in beautiful band Canada at this really nice scenic lake and today I am going to show you how I shoot freerunning with the hero pro black. That's cool I can hit that rock and I can jump up there. The different shots that I usually get is like a wide establishing shot, showing people the jump. Where I'm at, what I'm about to do and they can get a really nice impression of the whole big picture. I like to crop in show how big is by doing a low angle shot of the action. Get in slow mo so you can slow it down. And then to wrap it up I usually get a POV shot, just giving the people that first-person experience of what it feels to be like a freerunner and just give that sensation of actually doing a flip. And that's it, that was like the key ingredients big establishment shot, POV shot, low angle and slow mo and you got a really nice freerunning sequence. Sick! Cool I like it a lot. Stop it, yeah, heck yeah. Sick. Nice.",
