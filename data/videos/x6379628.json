    "description": "Jared Mell is a surfer's surfer. His approach to riding logs can be best described as modern classic\u2014or Surf-a-Billy as he call it. He's most known for his nimble, cat-like footwork on the front of a 10' surfboard, but don't overlook his ability to surf just about any kind of wave craft\u2014or couch. His love for traditional surfboards, old vinyl records, vintage cameras and natural herbs keep him rolling from continent to continent in search of his next ride. We love Jared Mell, and Jared Mell is now on SPY.",
