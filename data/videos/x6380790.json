    "description": "Spend five minutes with Michael Christmas and you\u2019ll find it difficult to resist his open smile and effortless confidence. Take another five to hear his music and you\u2019ll understand what he\u2019s so confident about: the Boston native\u2019s low key, hook-filled raps about good snacks and bad cars are as refreshing as skipping work to hang out with your old neighborhood friends. \n\nMichael Christmas came into the studio at Converse Rubber Tracks with a mindset that perfectly reflected his approach to music: humble, unpretentious, and totally confident in his ability to make fresh material.",
