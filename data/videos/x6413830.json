    "description": "Blending performance, craftsmanship and commitment to the environment has driven the Arbor Collective since 1995. Arbor Snowboard\u2019s 2015 Collection is the culmination of this intersection. A wide range of shapes and technologies is available throughout the line, guaranteeing a perfect board for all riding levels and terrain.\nHandpicked wood veneer top sheets give a unique fingerprint to every board made. Individualized and sophisticated, we use a variety of wood throughout the line ranging from palisander to burled eucalyptus, which can also be found as high-end interior trim on luxury cars, boats, and jets.\nOur new collection represents the best of performance and design while maintaining a commitment to environmental responsibility. To that end, a portion of every sale is donated to groups that restore forest ecosystems such as The Hawaiian Legacy Forests.\nTo learn more about Arbor Snowboards visit: arborcollective.com\/snowboards",
