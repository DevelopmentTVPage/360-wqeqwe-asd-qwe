    "description": "Ceremony has always been a band that has done things their own way. From coming up in the LA hardcore scene to joining forces with renowned indie label Matador Records they have never been confined to a scene, genre or aesthetic. One of the most recognizable elements of the band is the always great cover art photography shot by lead singer Ross Farrar. In the latest Converse X Filter Collaboration we talk to Ross about how the images he has captured over the years are such a central part of what the band is about.",
