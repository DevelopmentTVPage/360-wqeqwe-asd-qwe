To Myself\" as a way to connect with my fans I stepped out of the studio and into my own world I went to the woods by the beach recorded with an orchestra in a concert hall and recorded in my own bedroom with Beats, my journey becomes your journey you feel like you're with my friends sitting by the bonfire and with me in the car you hear everything I heard and feel everything I felt everything I did was to let you hear the voice that's inside of me this is the music I want you to experience Music The Way The Artist Intended.",
