    "description": "The Hurley Art Department spent last week at Marina High School in Huntington Beach for a mural collaboration. With the help of the Art Team, the students worked out a design to showcase the school's diversity. The kids came up with the concept of using puzzle pieces to make up their school's shield. Working with the school colors blue and gold, students were each able to design their own puzzle piece, creating a unified whole from individual parts. Last week saw the project's completion along with a well deserved pizza party and high fives! Video: YB",
