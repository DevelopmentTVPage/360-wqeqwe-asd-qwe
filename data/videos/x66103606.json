    "transcripts": "The impact of water on people's lives is significant lots and lots of people don't have access to clean water and so they spend a lot of time fetching water in polluted rivers and streams and the water sector in general has invested billions of dollars in projects around the world that have broken. The thing that bothers me is that a lot of the people who are walking down to the polluted water sources are actually walking past broken Clean Water Acoints. So we basically sat back and said the only way to solve this problem is to wipe it out in this district. To make that happen we invest in the pipes, in the taps and all of that to make the water flow, but more importantly we invest in the people who will manage that work overtime, so that we know that the problem is solved. Water for people is so excited about the partnership that we have forged with TOMS, so you go and you buy a bag of TOMS coffee and in return Water for people will ensure that one person has water for a full week. So the more coffee you buy, the more coffee you enjoy, the more people we can support around the world with clean water.",
