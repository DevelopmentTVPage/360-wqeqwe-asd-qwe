    "description": "Cowtown Skateboards holds it down in Arizona as the state's home shop. Prior to Cowtown opening in 1997, skateboarding in Arizona was desolate. Now that the company has four locations with Nick Trapasso and Robbie Brockel to call Cowtown their home, this company has breathed life into Arizona skateboarding. There's a reason why this shop already has a Brick and Mortar, watch their video and find out.",
