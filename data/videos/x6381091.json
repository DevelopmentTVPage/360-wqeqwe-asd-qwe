    "description": "Bay area heavy rock supergroup Golden Void materialized from Earthless guitarist Isaiah Mitchell's blazingly psychedelic riffs, Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound's Camilla Saufly-Mitchell's looming organ playing, and the heavy-as-hammers rhythm section of Aaron Morgan and Justin Pinkerton, who had been playing together in various bands since high school days. Watch as they take us on a trip through the hay day of San Francisco rock during \"Rise to the Out of Reach\"\/ \"Smiling Raven\".\n\nFor more on Converse Rubber Tracks:\nhttp:\/\/www.converse.com\/rubbertracks\n\nOn June 28th Converse will open it's San Francisco store on 838 Market St. Be sure to check it out!",
