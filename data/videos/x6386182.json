Nate qualified for the World Tour in 2010 and got a chance to experience life competing on the WCT. After a mid year cut, he was forced back onto the Qualifying Series and eventually lost his main sponsor. After almost calling it quits, Nate worked hard to get back on top, not without frustrations and failures along the way. With a win at the 2014 O\u2019Neill Coldwater Classic, Nate has been given a chance to live out his dream, again.
