    "description": "The Highground is a new board for 2013, and is our answer to the demand for a tapered race oriented topmount.\nThis board includes more than a few features to make it the board you want underfoot when you get the starting line. Humps pressed into the concave on the front create a bowl for your front toes to rest in, giving leverage all the way around it. Flares on the back end ramp up the concave where the gas pedals extend, offering superior connection to your board during drifts, allowing you to cut the right amount of speed and no more. W-concave creates a channel for your back foot rest in, letting you stay tucked and keep speed longer, without compromising front foot comfort.\nL: 36.00\"\nW: 10.00\"\nWB: 26.5-29.625\"\nThe 2013 Highground features a Hawaiian Koa bottom sheet with art by Eric Waetzig.\nDesigned by team rider Duke Degen\n\nRiders: Duke Degen and James Kelly",
