All of these suits were designed and built by O'Neill's Area 52 R&D facility.  \n\nWhat is Area 52?\n\nAREA 52: O\u2019Neill\u2019s exclusive R&D facility, staffed by full time engineering, design and prototyping teams who work closely with The World\u2019s Best Athletes to push the limits of wetsuit technology.\n\nAREA 52: allows us to hand-build and refine multiple rounds of prototypes in the same fashion that Jack himself pioneered over sixty years ago. Extensive prototyping, fit checks and testing in the frigid waters of Northern California provides unparalleled insight when creating the best fitting, most functional wetsuits on the planet. O\u2019Neill Wetsuits is still located in Santa Cruz, California, the birthplace of modern cold water surfing and the proving ground for materials, features and benefits that keep you in the water longer. Over 60 years and countless industry firsts later, O\u2019Neill\u2019s commitment to leading innovation continues stronger than ever.",
