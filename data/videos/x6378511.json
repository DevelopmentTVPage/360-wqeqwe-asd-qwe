    "description": "What happens when an artist realizes he's \"not an angry teenager anymore\" and decides to delve into music genres previously unknown to the angry teenage mentality? You get Jean Noir, a pleasant, LA-based twosome who we lent our music studio to not that long ago. Jean Noir set out with the intent to be neither rock nor alternative, though they haven't lost their edge in the transition, as their EP stands tall in a land of indie white noise. With songs like Sycamore and Graveyard Smash, Jean Noir might just set the soundtrack to your summer. Check out their just-released EP on iTunes and stay tuned for a full length album in the next few months.",
