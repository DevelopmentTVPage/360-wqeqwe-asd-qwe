    "description": "It\u00b9s a rare thing these days, in the age of the internet and all, when you can honestly say an amateur skater paid his dues to earn what he\u00b9s got, but for Nick Garcia, there's nothing truer than that. Skating his ass off, and getting noticed the old fashioned way. \"The harder you work the luckier you get\" and with that said, we are proud to introduce Element\u00b9s newest pro, Nick Garcia.\n\nHere's a look back at Nick's skating through the years, from featuring video highlights, print articles, and magazine covers from the past five years, ending on his recent footage and first pro ad.\n\nEdited by:\nRicki Bedenbaugh\n\nOriginal soundtrack by:\nLoren Humphrey",
