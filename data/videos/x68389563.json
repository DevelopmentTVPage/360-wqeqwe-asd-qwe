    "transcripts": "This no with this two-run format because semifinals were canceled earlier in the week we have a super final here so 32 riders with only two runs there's a lot of jeopardy there. Now we saw a lot of sept toods earlier in the pres how one of the best all-round riders and people mistakenly years ago you know labeled him just a jumper and then he put, put out a street snowboarding part that literally blew minds it was unbelievable. You saw it there on the open, slowed it down and went all the way through that double kink crumple. That's up, inverted front side five woo, there it is, the cab 12 nose grab this kid's air awareness is incredible, front side double cork 1080 will we see the triple right now? A late cork backside 10, wow really unique trick from Sebastian Toot right there.",
