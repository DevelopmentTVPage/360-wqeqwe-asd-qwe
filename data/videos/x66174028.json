    "transcripts": "There was many times when uncertainty came and I didn't know what was going on. At that point it was really scary, it felt like there was no way out. I just wanted more of my life, I know I wanted my gift to shine in the world stage. Everyone says \"Awe that kid has talent, it on;y goes so far.\" I wasn't the fastest, I didn't jump the highest, I just kind of grinded it away and made it happen. Whatever that mental block is, those who are the strongest gonna push through. I decided I'm gonna stop being stagnant and I'm going to push through on with life and chase my dreams.That moment the switch flipped and it was like I can do this. It's just silent, I don't hear any cheers I don't hear anything. Were at this levels because we didn't stop. I do what i'm doing right, I will be anyone. I wasn't gonna let nobody, nobody take what was at the mountain for me I was gonna get it. [Music Playing] Walking your own path that's much more fulfilling than doing what I thought was the normal.",
