    "description": "Converse Skate Ambassador Pontus Alv had the idea to make a little film about cruising around Paris with a jump ramp and a couple of plates, inspired by 1989 and the Converse CONS CTAS Pro Skate sneakers.\n\nThis era of skateboarding means so much as it was when street skating really broke though; it ripped out of California and spread around the world like wild fire. It created the foundation for what skateboarding is today. \n\nThis film is a celebration of that time. It inspired us. We hope it inspires you. Go build a jump ramp and explore.\n\nLust For Youth \"Behind Curtains\" from Growing Seeds courtesy of Sacred Bones Records.\nAvailable on iTunes \u00a9 2013.",
