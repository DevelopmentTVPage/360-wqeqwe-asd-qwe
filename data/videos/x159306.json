    "description": "We just wrapped our event in Virginia Beach enjoying fun 1-2ft waves with some bigger sets. The INT soft tops were the call for the soft conditions, and the kids made great use of them. Virginia Beach is a hotbed of classic long boarding talent, and this was apparent throughout the entire event. On hand we had Mikey DeTemple, Mitch Abshere, Aamion Goodwin, Noah Snyder and Scotty Stopnik to help our younger competitors and give pointers to the more advanced attendees. All in all it was a great event with even better vibes. | Video: Noah Snyder",
