    "description": "Inspiring and motivational best describe Darius Glover. Darius has been riding dirt bikes since he was 7 years old. At 15, everything changed when he suffered a life changing injury during a race; paralysis from the waist down. Undeterred by those telling him he'd never ride again, Darius has found a way not only to ride dirt bikes, but to compete at the highest level of motocross. Recent stints at the X Games and qualifications at Loretta Lynns show that no matter the situation, it's possible to do anything you want.",
