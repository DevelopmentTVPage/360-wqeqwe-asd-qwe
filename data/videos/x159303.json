    "description": "We just wrapped up our first stop in the north east, with 60 kids joining in on the fun in Ocean City, NJ. The waves were small and the water was cold, but the kids were stoked regardless. We had Rob Machado, Aamion Goodwin, Andrew Gesler, and Noah Snyder on hand to keep thigns fun. Due to the 1-2ft surf, INT soft boards and Riviera Paddleboards were the equipment of choice for all our competitors. A special thanks to our tour roadies who planned their summer vacation to follow the tour up the coast, as well as to the McGrath family for their hospitality. We hope to see all of you again next year, thank you! Click 'Full Story' for some pics from the day, and here for the full gallery. Video: Noah Snyder",
