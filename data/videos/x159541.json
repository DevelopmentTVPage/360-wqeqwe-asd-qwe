    "description": "Virginia Beach sure knows how to have fun. Today's RMSS event at the 1st Street jetty was one to remember. We saw another two-year-old mini-grom get some great rides. Noah Snyder and Colin Herlihy got smothered by out-of-control groms in all sorts of condiments, pies and raw eggs. World Tour surfers Brett Simpson and Ace Buchan arrived to join in on the fun. And rounding out the day's action was Hunter Smith, who busted out his floaties and gold sequin headband for the final. His snazzy surf accessories and creative maneuvers ended up landing him a first place finish. Photos\/video: PK.",
