    "description": "A Space2Play is anywhere that reflects the fun part of life. It's where you find your passion, your smiles, your laughter, and your personal escape. In this new web series, Sanuk celebrates these glorious moments with sneak peek into the lives of our athletes\/ambassadors through the lens of iconic photographer, Steve Sherman.\n\nThe second installment of this 10-part series, features Maui native and Sanuk youngblood, Matt Meola. Mr. Meola is one of the most positive, creative, and humble individuals in the game right now. Watch as he gets ambushed by a band of acid-trippin-hippies, gives a tour of both his shaper's factory and his own digs, and showcases some of his raw talent at his home-break on Maui. Stay tuned... things get weird...in a good way.\n\nCreated by: Scott Nichols",
