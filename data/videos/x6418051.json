    "description": "Based out of Oregon, Brandon Tissen is on the cutting edge of downhill skateboarding by being on the forefront of the 'skate everything' movement. His style matched with technical ability makes him the perfect compliment to an already incredible team.\nIn Brandon's first video with Arbor (film\/edit Jack Boston), he demonstrates how to push the limits in skating by showing the versatility one skater can have. You can see him flawlessly skate the Backlash through rural hills, and navigate through the urban streets of Portland on the Shakedown. \nEnjoy the video, and see first hand how downhill skateboarding is taken on a new look!\nTo learn more about Arbor Skateboards visit: arborcollective.com\/skateboards",
