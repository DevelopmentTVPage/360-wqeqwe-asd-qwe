I'll put my head down and put everything I have into that last 50 meters to hit the wall first I've learned a lot more from my disappointments than I did for my successes especially me always wants the success in the pool and having those disappointments I feel like it's a blessing in disguise but has helped me become a better person and swimmer. I learned from defeat and know what I have to work on to be successful the next time I know that I'm gonna have to have a goal each day so that I can stay on that path and accomplish my ultimate goals.",
