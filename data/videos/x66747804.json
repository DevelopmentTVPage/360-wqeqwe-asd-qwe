    "transcripts": "When we embarked on this journey we wanted to have not only an electrifying and dynamic looking cleat, but a cleat that performed at the highest level. Bryce was really involved in this process we captured some of his personality and also some of the things that are really important to him. Starting with where he's from you know and getting the Vegas skyline detail on there, with the mountains in the background. His logo the 34 and the BH intertwined. How the shoe is constructed was important that we build a shoe in a way that was both very light, but also very strong at Under Armour we're all about material innovation the polyurethane yarns they're very strong very light, but also very breathable he specifically called out I just want a cleat that I feel really locked in, 9-spike play configuration gives him just the right amount of support, but also the right amount attraction. It's got that tremendous power with this ankle strap you're much more stable charge pushing this full-length missile, resilient, responsive goes from the heel all the way to the toe. Gave him great range of motion that sneaker like fir and feel. It really delivers on something that wasn't really possible before we've designed the most innovative baseball cleat Under Armour's ever made.",
