    "description": "The Penny \"Pouch\" was developed through the necessity of getting to your destination on your skateboard and being able to carry your board in a simple and functional way once you get there. Not only do these backpacks serve a functional purpose but they are also fashionable with a range of colors to suit your every mood. \n\nFrom the simple and sophisticated blue, grey and black to the extra eccentric and colorful Splatter design, this range of backpacks certainly is uniquely Penny. Not only are our backpacks good for carrying your board but we have ensured that there is enough room for all your essentials, whether that be your laptop, tablet, stationary, books or water bottle. \n\nIf you're looking for something that looks good, works well and gives that colorful feeling that only Penny can, then you've come to the right place! The Penny \"Pouch\" is a must have in your Penny collection so make sure you get yours today!",
