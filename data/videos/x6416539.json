Instead of offering a cash prize, or a car, or any monetary reward, we've decided to offer these contest winners something else: the experience of a lifetime.\n\nEach winner from our Element Make It Count International Contest Series wins a trip to California, to skate with the Element team, visit Element Skate Camp, The Berrics, Nyjah's private park, and ultimately have a shot at Element Sponsorship.\n\nThe level of skating that this group of young rippers posses is unreal, and we just about shut down every spot we went to with our crew of 25. Although we spent a week on the road together, skating and becoming life-long friends, there could only be one winner in the end.
