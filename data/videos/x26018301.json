    "description": "No one ever created anything new by trying to be someone else. Leo Messi, the greatest player in the history of football, challenges you to make your own path and unfollow him in pursuit of creating your own game.\n \nFour time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or, Messi, adored and followed by fans all over the world, has received the highest accolades from those both inside and outside the game. But football has changed and Lionel Messi has challenged the next generation of players. Don't consider Messi your hero, consider him your competition.\n \nThe game played on streets, pitches and parks across the world is about making your own impact, about seeing what you want and taking it. Try and learn how to play like Messi, but then go out and create something new.",
