Taking a cleaner approach to the brand\u2019s timeless style of jeans and chinos, Volcom has streamlined their fits across the entire pants category and elevated the performance features on every pair of jeans.  With their deep roots in skateboarding and using history as a guide, Volcom has taken the last 25 years of designing pants and scrutinized and modernized every last detail to create a line of jeans and chinos made from high quality materials and construction methods while maintaining the key signature details they\u2019ve become known for.  Every pair of Volcom jeans features felled interior stitching and clean finished pocket bags for added comfort and less chafing, nearly indestructible buckle button closure and upgraded dual finish hardware for increased durability, a hidden phone pocket and double belt loops for convenient utility, while the asymmetrical detail of the offset back yoke and the \"V\" belt loop remain uniquely Volcom.\n\nShop Volcom Jeans: http:\/\/www.volcom.com\/jeans\nShop Volcom Chinos: http:\/\/www.volcom.com\/chinos\n\nFeaturing the original song \"Real Life\" by Fat Tony\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/volcoment\/real-life\n\n&\n\nSon Little \"Cross My Heart\" from his self-titled album \nhttps:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/son-little\/id1022021046\n\n&\n\nCuz Lightyear \u201cSometimey\u201d from the album CUZ\nhttps:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/cuz\/id1048034378",
