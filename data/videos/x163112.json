    "description": "Last Sunday on October 20th, Alex Midler held his third Annual 'Roll-A-Thon' to benefit the 'Johnny Kicks Cancer Foundation'. The mission of 'Johnny Kicks Cancer' is to cure childhood leukemia through awareness and funding for cutting-edge research, as well as to empower and encourage patients, families and doctors in their fight against the number one childhood cancer. We had raffles for $1,000 shopping sprees at Volcom and Deluxe, as well as a paid trip to Camp Woodward. There was also food from Wahoo's, ice cream from Ian's Ice Cream and a silent auction for a bunch of awesome gift packs from various companies who were generous enough to donate product for the event! Check out the photos below to see what went down!\n\n- Music -\nSong: \"All I Wanna Do\"\nArtist: Splashh\nAlbum: Comfort",
