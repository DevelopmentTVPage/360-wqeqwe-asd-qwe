The collaboration's first effort is a short video documenting the organization's mission and the work they did on the \"Great West Coast Migration\" tour, a traveling art show supported by artists from around the world, including longtime Arbor Collective artist, Dave Kinsey.  The show will be back on the road later this year traveling through Asia.  To learn more about this amazing organization and the Great West Coast Migration \n\nVist ArborCollective.com for more",
