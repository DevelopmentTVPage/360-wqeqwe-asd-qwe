What would be a unique point of view that we could take and we had an idea to create a 4 wheel drive an all terrain vehicle for the wrist and that's where the idea of the Mission was born. We wanted to build a product that you could get outside and explore surfing and snowboarding and really be able to take this smart technology with you anywhere you go.",
