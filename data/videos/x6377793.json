    "description": "The Bogart is our smallest and most versatile wheel. It changed Bill's life, and it can change yours. Bill believes in the Bogart so much that he takes to the streets spread the Sucrose gospel, making sure everyone knows the Bogart is the ideal size for your cruiser or city slasher board, and comes equipped with a stoneground finish to slide perfect right out of the packaging. Big round lips keeps the slides smooth, and make sure these wheels roll smoothing on all surfaces. The core offset helps slow you down in slides, and even contributes to grip when you really need to lean into things. If you care about the children, check out the Bogart.\nThe Bogart weighs in at 61mm tall, with a 36mm contact patch and 2.5mm core offset. It comes in 82a in all five colors.\nThe Sucrose Initiative was developed to bring together rider based design, performance across a wide range of conditions, and an effort to start reducing our reliance on petroleum based materials to make these wheels the highest performing and cheapest lift ticket on the hill.\nTo top it off, our exclusive Sugar Formula has a 10% natural Sucrose content which lessens our reliance on petroleum and provides a realistic step in preserving our environment.\nCheck out the whole lineup of Sucrose Initiative wheels at: arborcollective.com\/skateboards\/products\/wheels\/\nRiders: Will Clay, Norman Plante, Cooper Darquea, Daniel Macdonald\nFilm\/Edit: Tom Flinchbaugh",
