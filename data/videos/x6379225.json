    "description": "Every piece of a skate shoe matters, and etnies carefully designs each style to improve overall performance. The skateboarder-owned brand pushed the envelope even farther by including STI Evolution Foam\u2122 midsoles and outsoles.\nSTI Evolution Foam\u2122 replaces your typical EVA, PU and heavy rubber with a durable, abrasion-resistant, ultra-lightweight and high-impact rebound cushioning foam. The foam technology is used as a single solution for the midsole and outsole, its molecular build is more resistant to abrasion and has a high-impact rebound quality so it won't pack out when landing hard.\nInstead of being die-cut from a sheet, STI Evolution Foam\u2122 midsoles are made by a special molding process, producing no waste.\nPlus, STI Evolution Foam\u2122 enhances the cushioning and comfort of the footbed and noticeably decreases the weight of the shoe. That\u2019s a lot of performance-driven features in a single piece of foam.\nLearn more about STI Evolution Foam\u2122 and view the collection: etnies.com\/evolutionfoam",
