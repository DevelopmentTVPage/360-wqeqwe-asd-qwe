    "description": "Dubai is probably not the first place you would think of when planning a snowboard trip, but the heart of adventure lies in act of defying the conventional and thinking outside of the box. Quite ironically, in this case that actually meant thinking inside the box, because the only place to go snowboarding in Dubai is a giant refrigerator encased within The Mall of the Emirates. You read that right; we rounded up the Arbor team and took a snowboarding trip to the world's largest indoor snow slope, within one of the world's biggest shopping malls, which is situated in one of the world\u2019s most expansive deserts. Unconventional, but such is snowboarding in the Middle East.",
