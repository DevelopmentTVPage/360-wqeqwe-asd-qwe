    "description": "Cooper Darquea spent the day relaxing in Venice to contemplate why the Sucrose Initiative Summit is his favorite wheel. Our Sugar formula poured around the the Groovetube core provides fast roll speed and rebound, and the Summit shape gives you a great balance of top speed and acceleration all while providing the most grip possible and smooth drifting characteristics. This wheel is ideal for racecourses and fast bombs, and makes a great freeride wheel once worn down.\n\nThe Vice weighs in at 71mm tall, with a 56mm contact patch and 2.5mm core offset. It comes in 78a in all five colors.\n\nThe Sucrose Initiative was developed to bring together rider based design, performance across a wide range of conditions, and an effort to start reducing our reliance on petroleum based materials. The combination of our highly durable Sugar formula, proprietary shape, and exclusive Groovetube Core make these wheels the highest performing and cheapest lift ticket on the hill.\nTo top it off, our exclusive Sugar Formula has a 10% natural Sucrose content which lessens our reliance on petroleum and provides a realistic step in preserving our environment.\n\nRiders: Norman Plante, Cooper Darquea, Will Clay\nFilm\/Edit: Tom Flinchbaugh",
