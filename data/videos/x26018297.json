Here we have the Brazilian judoka Mayra Aguiar, who has already depicted her talent on mats in Paris, London, Tokyo, Guadalajara, Toronto and more. Watch and you\u2019ll see her in a unique experience in her own country, Brazil, training on the top of the mountain Pedra da G\u00e1vea, in Rio de Janeiro. \n\nThe mat at Pedra da G\u00e1vea may be something new to Mayra, but she has been training since she was 6 years old. By the age of 11, she had already started the routine of two training sessions a day, six days a week.  \n\nVideo Credits:\n\nDirection: \nLuigi Cani \nMikael Santiago \nCaio Amato \n\nExecutive Production:\nRodrigo Selva \u201cCalota\"\n\nProduction:\nLuana Calainho\nGilson \n\nAssistant Production:\nMariana Gomes \nEduardo Rodrigues\n\nFinal Cut:\nPedro Dias \nSabrina Gortz",
