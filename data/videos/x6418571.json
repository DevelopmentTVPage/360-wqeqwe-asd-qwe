    "description": "Issue no. 39 of Monster Children comes out June 7th - and with it comes a special treat. A treat for the eyes and the ears. A treat especially for the skate kid: it's the 2013 Team Average trip, filmed in New Zealand. Greyson Fletcher was part of it, and here he is, teasing said issue and movie release, voiced over with some thoughtful words from Dylan Reider. Watch it now, get psyched. Then wait just a little while for the real deal.",
