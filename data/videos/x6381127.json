    "description": "As part of our Wall to Wall series, Californian Beau Stanton took an interesting approach to an exceptionally ornate piece. Painting with oil and using light manipulation, the surrealist painter produced his outdoor piece indoors, blending it into an existing wall in San Diego. The complexity isnt lost on the viewer, but Beau's effortless style is visible in the details.\n\nFor more on the Wall to Wall series:\nhttp:\/\/www.Converse.com\/WalltoWall",
