    "transcripts": "When I was 13 years old um life kind of came to halt and I lost my arm to a shark surfing out in Hawaii. And that was definitely a huge obstacle I had to overcome and you know at the time I did have a relationship with God which was something that really carried me through this obstacle that I had to overcome. And It's just amazing to look back on it now and just see how good God has been in my life and how he can take what seems like something so awful and turn it into something so beautiful. Today I am a professional surfer and motivational speaker, and I get to share my story with people all over the world and more importantly share Jesus Christ and his love for them and yeah it's amazing to see how an obstacle can turn your life upside down, but turn it into something totally awesome.",
