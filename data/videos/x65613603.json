    "description": "Looking for something fun to do this weekend? Get outdoors and make your own adventures on a road trip with friends! Suss out some sweet skating spots that no one else knows about and let the good times roll on with your penny skateboard underfoot and smiles all round. Whether you\u2019re into tricks, carving it up or just cruising past the scenery \u2013 leave that stressful week behind and have a weekend full of fun! \n\nPlease note, if you jump in a lake, river, ocean or any mass of water, you may experience just as much fun as we did! BUT, you'll probably need to change your bearings - or at least take them apart to dry them off thoroughly.",
