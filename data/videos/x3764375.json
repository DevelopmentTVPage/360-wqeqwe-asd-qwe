    "description": "A San Jose, CA. native, Zack has seen every corner of the city. As a kid he moved around constantly, Zack used these formidable days to search out skate spots and refine his skills. Jumping on a TMA trip to Barcelona Spain, pushed him into home studies and provided an opportunity to skate with some of Tiltmodes finest players.\nWhen life deals you lemons... Zack retreated to the wood shop to keep those creative juices flowing and help him push past health issues. Back on the board, the San Jose \"King of POP\" skates with pure stoke.",
