    "description": "n this episode the Arbor Skateboard team including Duke Degen, Eric Singer, James Kelly, Max Myers, Kody Noble, and Jimmy Riha moves from one unbelievable locale to another. After leaving the twin facing roads behind, they make the commute to James' cabin further north where they meet up with his Grandpa to share a drink and some laughs. The next day takes them to one of the most iconic and heaviest roads in downhill skateboarding. With sections of 55+ mph and others with 22% grade, this road is nothing to scoff at, and requires the team to be on point with their skills to ensure that they leave safely.\nFilmed & Edited: Michael Alfuso\nCheck out Arbor everywhere:\narborcollective.com",
