    "description": "The Cypher is a drop-through board designed to get sideways with lots of features to help you stay that way.\nThis board includes 1\/2\" of rocker through the length of the deck, getting you lower to the ground for easier, bigger, and longer power slides. Mellow tub concave and an ample width keep you glued to the deck without cramping your feet or your style, meaning you can keep the style session rolling all day.\nL: 38.00\"\nW: 10.25\"\nWB: 30.50\"\nThe 2013 Cypher features a Hawaiian Koa bottom sheet with art by Eric Waetzig.\nDesigned by team rider Duke Degen\nRider: Duke Degen\nCheck out the Cypher here - arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/449670\/cypher",
