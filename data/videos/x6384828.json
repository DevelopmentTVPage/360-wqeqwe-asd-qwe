    "description": "Raul Navarro made it from his suburban hometown of El Prat de Llobregat to the streets of Barcelona where he now considers his home. In the late 90's his skating evolved during the lunch breaks of his full-time job at the local skate shop.  His natural skills exploded into the ledge-controlled-madness we all know today. With his eyes always firmly fixed on the city of San Francisco, he made it out to the west coast of the USA to become part of SF's finest FTC and ride for Western Edition where he got his name and face on a board... so it was just a matter of time before he got his name and face on his favorite adidas shoe.",
