    "description": "Where do we begin with Bob Burnquist's run at this year's X Games? Do we start by telling you about the ramp he had to skate? Hint: he had to take an elevator to get to the top. Or the lower back injury that made him question if he would even be able to skate? Or how despite being injured he pushed through to win gold on the Mega Ramp? Or do we just sum it up by saying Bob's the man? Well, Bob is the man and here's the video to prove it.",
