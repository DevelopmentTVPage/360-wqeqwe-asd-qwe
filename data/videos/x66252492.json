    "transcripts": "The quest is always to make the ultimate cold wear performance wetsuit, to keep brief with the E5 flash lining  is to take out a little flash lining and make it as stretchy as any other material we have, quick drying, and warmth and high stretch all together in one, you  basically have E5. Yeah it's always exciting you know given uh a very slimline, you start to get the feedback you know from the team in particular the feedback was super positive it's providing twenty-five percent more stretch the durability as you increase and the counter has just gone to another level. And the new E5 material was incredible we'll start flexible and just easy to get on and off and held the warmth for us with the flexibility too just made it easy to travel around inside warm and yeah I'm siked on it.",
