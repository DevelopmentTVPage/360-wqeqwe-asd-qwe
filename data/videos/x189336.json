    "description": "Couldn't get enough of The Deathwish Video? Neither could we. Fortunately there's more. We were crawling around on the Deathwish cutting room floor looking for scraps and we found these perfectly fine little gems of KR3W pro riders Erik Ellington and Lizard that didn't make it into the final edit. We're pleased to be able to give them a home in this edition of KR3W KLIPS. \n\nSITE: http:\/\/kr3wdenim.com\/",
