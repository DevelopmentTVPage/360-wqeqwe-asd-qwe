    "description": "Nothing generic here. \"From the ground up\" as we say, each season we listen to the needs and wants of our team and design and build the best product possible. This season we welcome the new; Unit SS in its full body armor, the upgraded Rover SS along with the reinterpretation of a legacy, The Don. We've added a smaller size to the ever-popular Kensington so it's twice the fun and are bringing the new with The Shelley. We have seaworthy apparel selections in classic silhouettes, in addition to a Camouflage Collection with detail in the designs. With materializations ranging from functional canvases and comfy cottons to ballistic grade nylons and manly leathers, options are aplenty giving you choices beyond the norm. This is Nixon now. Nice to meet you.",
