    "description": "Volcom Peanut Butter & Rail Jam LAAX | 01.02.2014\nThe first stop of the Volcom PBRJ European Tour was hosted by the european mecca of snowboarding, LAAX. This resort is just awesome...location, support and atmosphere have been just great as the previous years and we had a blast there.\nThe LAAX shaper crew built a very creative set-up, fun to ride for all riders from the Pros tot he groms. It consisted of a downrail with a pole jam entry, a Y shaped flat-down rail, and a curved \u201edown tube\". It made for opportunities of all different kind of tricks.\nAt the beginning oft he day the strong south winds were problematic, menacing tents, riders and rails to fly away, but during the day the sun showed up and somehow ist rays shined the wind away. Pretty good move...\nThe contest started at noon, and became immediately serious...from the beginning to the end we saw all kinds of presses, slides and combos you can imagine. It was great to see such a highly motivated bunch of shredders. Even the 15 and under division was killing it with plenty of tricks and the perfect one footed boardslide on the Y rail has to be mentioned here by the youngest competitor!\nSamuel Camenzind Took top honors in this division getting a freee Nitro boards and tons of prizes, while in the 16-21 division Arturs Cukunde took the win getting himself a good Volcom prize bag and a pair of Union bindings.\nIn the girls division, the level was quite impressive but once again Joelle JJ juchli, dominated the pack of good sheboarders friends. Really inspirating to see a Jam of all good friends!\nIn the Open division were the cash prizes got split, Rino Wenger was the most consistent rider and took home 500chf with almost no bails and solid tricks.\nLocal shaper Jeron Lohner, was voted by the judges the most impressive rider of the whole event, killed the set-up with some sick transfer jibs and won the paid trip to compete to the World PBRJ Championships in Mammoth Mountain, in California!!!\nAltogether it was a banger start in LAAX, we`re looking forward to next year. Big thanks to the LAAX shaper crew and resort!\nFurther thanks to everybody who helped to make this event so epic and of course to all our partners",
