    "description": "The Rocker System is Arbor\u2019s reverse camber platform. Rocker is created by replacing the lengthwise positive arc of a traditional camber snowboard, with a reverse shape similar to the profile of a surfboard. The design eliminates the leverage required to release and re-engage a camber snowboard\u2019s outside contact points, creating a more seamless ride. Rocker delivers easier turn initiation, cleaner tracking across the snow, better float in powder, and more fluid spins and slides.\n \nMany rocker designs do not provide all the performance needed for more technical riding. The System addresses this need for performance by delivering amazing edge hold, without forfeiting any of the benefits of riding true rocker. The design brings together a Parabolic shape with our Grip-Tech sidecut to create an outstanding platform for all types of riding.\n \nThe Rocker System by Arbor Snowboards \u2013 all the fun of a rocker design \u2013 with reliable performance at all levels.\nParabolic Rocker is a true rocker design that progressively reduces the amount of rocker toward the tip and tail. This ensures that the outside contact points are close enough to the snow to engage when maximum edge performance is required \u2013 higher speeds, loaded turns, and bigger landings.\nGrip Tech is a sidecut design that adds four contact points under your feet. It provides a more ergonomic way to grip the snow when control is needed. Grip Tech also forms heel and toe pivot points that make turning easier and more natural.",
