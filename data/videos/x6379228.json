Skid Row is a scary and tough place to survive without a home and the reality is the homeless wear their shoes around the clock to keep their feet protected and warm. Each year etnies has the pleasure to personally witness the pure joy and relief a new pair of shoes brings to the lives of those less fortunate. etnies would like to share that experience with the world. Here is etnies\u2019 Journey to the Soles of Skid Row\u2019s Homeless. Featuring Pierre-Andre Senizergues, Ryan Sheckler, Cairo Foster, Nathan Williams, Ben Lewis, Tom Dugan and Levi Sherwood.",
