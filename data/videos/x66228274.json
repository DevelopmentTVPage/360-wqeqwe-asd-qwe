    "transcripts": "Our main goal is True to Trestles to tread lightly, bring awareness and give back. It's an honor to be able to work with sustainable surf, surfrider foundation, under swell, San Onofre Parks Foundation, and the state parks, and bring a great event down the Trestles. As the event organizer sustainability is the number one for us here at trestles this is one of the last natural water sheds in Southern California and we want to come down here and leave an event that's cleaner than when we showed up and we welcome back next year. When you purchase Volcoms True to trestles products 100% of the proceeds go to California State parks you can purchase them at Volcom.com, here on site, or any of our Southern California local retailers.",
