    "description": "His days managing the Del Mar Skate Ranch back in the early 80s gave Grant Brittain the perfect testing grounds to hone his photography skills. It was there that he grabbed a camera, a canister of 35mm film, and never looked back. Since then, Grant has gone on to photograph nearly every major skater that\u2019s come up, photo edit TransWorld SKATEboarding and launch The Skateboard Mag. With a camera in-hand, Grant has traveled the world many times over with the best guys in the business and is still the humble and rooted friend Nixon has worked alongside since day one.",
