    "transcripts": "I've always been around the guys it's difficult because they see me just as a girl. Since I was 4, my father always had bikes at home. I've always been on voice, I love it. I've been racing since. When I was little, my mother was scared and my father supported me to keep going. It's difficult to find a place because you have to prove over and over that you're good enough, why don't you believe in me if I have the same lap time as the winner? My biggest influence is my father. He has always been by my side, and never pressuring me. He's always there for me to get me back on the by, fuel me up and go again. He has always believed a girl like me can beat anyone. This is what motivates me to train and win.",
