    "transcripts": "So for this alphabet we're working with a bold kind of Tuscan style of lettering. It's called Tuscan because you've got these kind of spurred feet at the end of the letter form. It's kind of more of a bold blocky version than more con Tuscan have bold shapes. So I'm going to take this blank alphabet build out a bit of dimension and then add some color. I'm going to write the word rad. So this is the rad piece finished off. We started with our structural outline a little bit of dimension and then used the color to kind of give it a two tone shadow with the finishing up from the dots. All done.",
