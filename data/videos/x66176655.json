    "transcripts": "My name is Fernanda Maciel I'm a ultra-runner and I love my sport because I can travel around the world. So I am always exploring new mountains, new place and always quite place I love it. Many people can not understand why I run a lot. The hard part of my sport is to be always in shape with strong mind. Sometimes I go to visit my family in Brazil, I need to be far away from the high mountains but I cannot stop training. I have to work hard to follow and to get my abilities. I started working as a environmental lawyer but my love to be connected with the nature and the mountains was bigger than anything. Seven years ago I left my job as a lawyer and now I just run. It's my dream to climb Aconcagua running, it's almost 7,00 meters high. Many world champ runners have been there trying to do their record but there is no female record yet so i'd like to try it. I need to be training all the time everywhere so I need to be confident. When I am exhausted I don't feel my body, I cannot think I just run and this is about love and experience.",
