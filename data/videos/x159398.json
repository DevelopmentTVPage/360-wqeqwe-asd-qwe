    "title": "DANE ZAUN AND JON ROSE IN NICARAGUA WITH WAVES FOR WATER",
    "description": "It wasn't all fishing, cannonballing off the boat and surfing, the guys were doing some serious work down there. After all, there's no Nicaragua without \"agua\", and with that mantra in mind Jon Rose and Dane Zaun were able to provide the villages they visited with clean drinking water, while still getting to have a good time. Press play to see how good deeds and good surfing go hand in hand. Also be sure to read on for a letter from Jon Rose about the trip.",
