    "description": "Sometimes even the second smartest animal on the planet needs to get schooled on how things work. Norman Plante takes the time to present the finer points of the Sucrose Initiative 69mm Vice wheel, why it works so well and why this alternative helps reduce our reliance on petroleum.\n\nThe Vice weighs in at 69mm tall, with a 35.5mm contact patch and 2mm core offset. It comes in 80a in all five colors.\n\nThe Sucrose Initiative was developed to bring together rider based design, performance across a wide range of conditions, and an effort to start reducing our reliance on petroleum based materials. The combination of our highly durable Sucrose urethane, proprietary shape, and exclusive Groovetube Core make these wheels the highest performing and cheapest lift ticket on the hill.\n\nRiders: Norman Plante, Cooper Darquea\nFilm\/Edit: Tom Flinchbaugh",
