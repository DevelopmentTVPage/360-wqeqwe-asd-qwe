    "title": "G-Shock X Complex with Jeweler Gabriel Urist Featuring GA110",
    "description": "Gabriel Urist is a cutting edge jewelry designer, whose simple, often understated, style has allowed him to stand out in the bling-heavy, urban crowd. Legendary graphic artist Eric HAZE designed the G-Shock 30th anniversary logo, which became the focal point of Urist's original piece. Gabe created a ring to celebrate G-Shock's three decades, and the custom piece, which perfectly incorporates HAZE's logo, is as tough and stylish as the watches that inspired it: the GA110RG-1A, GA110RG-7A, and GA200RG-1A.",
