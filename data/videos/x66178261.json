I guess I chose future to be what's representing MNDR because I want to be up to day and hopefully bring in a sound that would be something fresh and new. The people that inspire me I really looked to the classics, I'm a huge  Kinx fan, and I'm a huge Carole King fan. As a musician I don't feel like it's about fashion as much as it's about style. For me I want to be able to go from street to stage. Currently I just started to tour with 10 tanks, I'm really excited about, I am doing another video with artist Cody Critcheloe from Ssion, the album is out this summer, It's called Feed Me Diamonds, which is a trial track off the record, it's classic pop rocker. Thank you Rolling Stone for all the support and of course thank you Ray-Ban, and congratulations on your 75th. [Music Playing]",
