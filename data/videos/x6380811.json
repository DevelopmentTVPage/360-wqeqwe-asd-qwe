    "description": "Cons rider Kevin Rodrigues collaborated with Ben Chadourne and Jean-Louis Huhta to bring you an audio visual representation of his skateboarding in Paris, France.\n\nKevin sourced a range of his own musical influences and worked closely with Jean-louis to create the bespoke composition tailored to suit this film. It was filmed and directed by Ben in the recent\nParisian winter months providing a cold, dark cityscape where everyone involved found a creative influence.\n\nAbout Kevin Rodrigues\nKevin grew up skateboarding in Paris, which has shaped his creatively rich diverse output.

His path is constantly heading in his own direction which will be further evident in his upcoming part in the new Polar Skate Co video.\n\nAbout Ben Chadourne\nHailing from Bordeaux, France, Ben made the natural transition from skateboarder to filmer, although don\u2019t think for a second his skating has slowed down!
