Bruno Passos, what can you tell us about Bruno, yeah right here on our sheets it says he's from Vista, California. He may live there now but he's one of Brazil's finest, grew up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with Bob Burquest. Bob Burnquest usually credits Bruno Passos for why he's skateboarding and this guy Bruno's usually behind the camera filming Bob, really amazing skateboard filmmaker and still so good at skateboarding, 5 0 to fakie through the corner. 8 seconds to go right now and so far I think this is the best run we've seen in the masters final. It's definitely the craziest line rolling into the corner hitting the smith That is going to be time right there, that is a perfect run, I think that's going to be in the 80's for Bruno Passos. I wouldn't, I wouldn't put it past him, just fallen off, but that was well after time so the judges are not going to score him down on that. And Darren's just a fun guy to skate with, he's got a great attitude, he's geeky, and his love of skateboarding. [Music Playing].",
