    "title": "Arbor Snowboards :: Mark Carter - Full Part",
    "description": "Few men can flip calves and ride horses as gracefully as they can flip tricks and ride mountains. Growing up on a cattle ranch in 10 Sleep, Wyoming, Mark Carter learned true grit from a young age and it shines through in his own personal brand of snowboarding. From big, sketchy lines to massive cheese wedges, Carter approaches the backcountry with an irreplaceable devil-may-care attitude that sets him apart from the herd.\n\nThe 2014-15 season was kind to Carter's winter home base of Jackson Hole, Wyoming allowing him to film the following full part almost entirely in his own backyard of the Teton Mountains. Carter is one hell of a snowboarder and we couldn't be more stoked to welcome him to the Arbor Snowboards Pro Team.\n\nFilmed By: Jake Price, Seth Huot, Trent Ludwig, Willie McMillon, Aaron Hooper, Canyon Florey, Will Brommelsiek, Wade Dunstan, and Jon Ray",
