    "transcripts": "The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland. Revered for it's beauty and respect for it's indigenous wildlife population. Crocodiles, tapirs, crabs but Cristian Dimitrus search for something much more dangerous and far more diabolical. The piranhas. Piranhas razor sharp teeth rip through almost anything. They whip into a feeding frenzy and leave nothing but bones. A truly spectacular creature lucky for Cristian he makes it out of this encounter with his life and all of his fingers.",
