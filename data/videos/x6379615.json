    "title": "Happiness Censored: SPY Happy Lens Billboard Removed",
    "description": "Happy to sit on your face... was SPY's latest billboard in Encinitas, CA and its first in a series leading up to next spring's release of a new patent-pending product called the Spy Happy Lens. The billboard sparked quite a controversy and despite its immensely positive reception by local citizens (70% approval on www.patch.com poll), a few complaints lead to its removal by the advertising space's owner just a week after its erection. Supporters of free speech and fans of Happy rallied behind the cause with a little \"tongue in cheek\" protesting on the morning of its removal, with local traffic showing their endorsement of the message. A follow up billboard will take its place, but in the meantime, Happiness will still prevail.",
