Global Communities provides new TOMS Shoes as part of their school uniform program, providing orphans and vulnerable children better access to education.\n\nIn addition, in their commitment to helping families in need, Global Communities also provides new TOMS to children whose families complete financial trainings. These trainings in lending and savings teach families how to become resistant to the economic challenges they may face daily.",

We are in more than 30 countries our main purpose is to reach by millions and try to need lift them out of poverty. TOMS shoes is just that perfect fit to what we do, we give the shoes to all the children of the members of savings and lending groups. The parents save up to a dollar-a-week so from the savings and lending group they were able to buy a small livestock, they're able to produce vegetables, tomatoes, and other fruits. So the impact is the increased resilience to the economic shocks. We have many group that are forming because they know that their neighbors received shoes parents are asking to join savings and lending group so to us it's a recruitment without any efforts, we have many members we can reach more people with uh all the range of services that we have to offer just because we're providing that pair of shoes in a certain community.",
