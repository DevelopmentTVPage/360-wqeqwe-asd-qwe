    "description": "We just wrapped up our Point Pleasant, New Jersey stop of the RMSS tour. We arrived at the beach with low expectations for surf, but were pleasantly surprised with 2-3ft fun little waves. The kids were surfing well on their INT soft boards and Toys bodyboards, doing tandem rides, jousting, and playing games of surf chicken. The 2-3ft little rollers soon turned into chest high shore break, which provided us with plenty of contenders for the Hi-Chew Wipe Out of the Day award. It was a great event and we can't wait for next year! Click 'Full Gallery' for some pics from the day, and click here for the full gallery. \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",
