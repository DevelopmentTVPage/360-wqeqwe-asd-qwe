    "description": "We showed up to Folly Beach, SC and were promptly greeted by a 7 AM thunderstorm (this didn't seem to happen when we were back in Huntington Beach..). But when the clouds cleared, we scored the most fun waves of the whole tour thus far. There were 2-3ft fun peaks all over the washout, with some even bigger sets coming in at times. All the boys were frothing to get in the water, with Scotty Stopnik was seen KILLING it on a Roberts Mush Machine while Pete Devries ripped on a T. Patterson. Even Taylor Pai himself threw on some fins and bodysurfed into some closeouts. We had about 66 kids on hand, and there were great vibes all around with everyone having a good time. This could have been due to the great waves, but we think it is simply indicative of how rad the southern community is. AJ Collins and Mitch Abshere both remarked about the high level of southern hospitality. Special Thanks to Parrot Surf Shop! | Video: Noah Snyder",
