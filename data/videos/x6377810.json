    "description": "The Arbor Skateboards family rolled deep to New Zealand for the Mt. Ruapehu Gravity Festival. Liam Morgan, James Kelly, Tyler Howell, Brandon Tissen, KJ Nakanelua, and Kaimana Pinto spent their time outside of the event finding new roads and pushing each other to the limit.\n \nWith the legendary Levi Hawken for a tour guide, the boys explore Wellington and the North Island of New Zealand, unearthing some amazing scenery and roads. Keep your eyes peeled for some near death experiences and some adrenaline pumping wipeouts as Jack Boston captures some of the best downhill skating on camera yet. It might be the wrong side of the road down there, but it sure feels right.\n \nCheck out Arbor's full lineup of Skateboards at: arborcollective.com\/skateboards\/",
