    "description": "Highlights from the first stop Arnette's 2012 Cash Pot Surf Series at San Diego's Seaside Reef. With the help of Transworld SURF, the event went down in 2-4 foot waves as stacked heats of surfers came from all over SoCal to paddle out for their chance to win a piece of the $3,000 up for grabs.\n\nWaves were shredded, good times were had and cash was handed out to the winners of each heat, as well as the top guys in the finals.\n\nCory Arrambide took first in the Pro-Am division and Taylor Clark earned top honors in the juniors.\n\nFuture 2012 Arnette Cash Post Surf Series dates and locations include:\n* 3\/03 -- Blackies, Newport Beach, CA\n* 3\/17 -- Ventura, Los Angeles, CA\n* 4\/21-22 (two day waiting period) -- Casino Pier, Seaside Heights, NJ\n* 7\/08 -- Kewalo Basin, Honolulu, HI\n* 7\/14 -- Steamer Lane, Santa Cruz, CA\n* 8\/13 -- Ponce Inlet, FL\n* 8\/17 --Outerbanks, NC\n\nLimited space is available at each event in the Cash Spot Surf Series, given out on a first come, first serve basis.
