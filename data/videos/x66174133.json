    "transcripts": "So it was thanksgiving morning and we went up to this cabin in Bear Lake, that our family had rented out for the weekend. Over night it had dropped about a foot of fresh snow, we rushed outside to go play in it. It was only a matter of seconds before my oldest son stumbled on what he thought was a dead cat. I didn't know what to do. You okay, buddy? My brother, he went over and scooped up the cat. Is he alive? He's a goner? Hi sweetie, no he's alive, no he's alive. Oh hi! We are bringing a cat back to life right now everyone!T hat's crazy, come on. \nBut maybe not, maybe gone, look at it. Put your ear up to him. I truly believe that there was no chance, everyone in the room was telling him that he should just give up. He's given it his all, but it was time to, time for him to stop. He did this for probably an hour or more, he refused to give up. One of it's eyes are open. Hey, kitty! Oh my goodness kitty you are alive! Look at you, I thought to myself we just witnessed a miracle. I want to bring it home, what we will not be able to do as much good for him as Becca can. Oh. This little guy now has a loving home, and he's recovering, and doing really well. [Music Playing]",
