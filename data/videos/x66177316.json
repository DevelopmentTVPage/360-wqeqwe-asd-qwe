    "transcripts": "I'm Mitch Marner and this is my Under Armour Interview. Growing up I had a nickname when I was really young, I don't know where it came from people used to call me Mickey Mouse. He's a small guy and had an energy that could last a lifetime, and you know never needed to rest he would always just be 24\/7 and that was one that kind of stuck with me for a little bit. Craziest prank, uh we have a hose in our shower that the water can go out like burning hot, almost too hot, so I remember someone was washing their hair or something and I walked in and someone turned it on and suddenly nobody really new about it,  and everybody just started feeling lava on their skin. Growing up I played multiple sports, I played lacrosse, soccer with school I usually sometimes play baseball, summertime is kind of crazy and our family household too cause my brother is playing hockey. Us playing hockey, we're both playing lacrosse, and soccer so a lot of driving around for my parents. Piece of Under Armour equipment that's I guess my whole under suits and everything I wear under my equipment to my tights, my upper and bottom tights, those two things I need to have in my hockey equipment or else it's to uncomfortable for me I can't deal with it.",
