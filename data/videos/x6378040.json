    "description": "In the first installment of the 2011 Get Elevated Series, the Arbor Skateboards team including James Kelly, Kody Noble, Max Myers, Eric Singer, Jimmy Riha and Duke Degen meet up at the Skate House in Los Angeles before heading Northeast into the Sierras. After a long drive and by sheer serendipity, they find a driving guide which leads to a road nestled in the mountain range nearby. Turns out the pavement is super burly with huge cracks across the road the entire way down. After the impromptu session is over, the team rests their heads in Mammoth Lakes in preparation to skate the area the following day. Days 2 and 3 will be featured in the in episode of the Get Elevated Tour.\nFilmed & Edited: Michael Alfuso\nPost Production Sound: Art Espinosa\nMusic: \"Try\" by ALO, \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival, \"Blowlamp the Kids\" by Bombazine Black",
