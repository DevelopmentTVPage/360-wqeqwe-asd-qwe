    "description": "The ETNIES & CINEMA BMX teams joined forces for another summertime adventure, this time in Portland, Oregon. Corey Martinez, Chase Dehart and Nathan Williams all ride for both etnies and CINEMA so it makes sense for both brands to collab on filming trips like this, but unfortunately, Nathan just had wrist surgery before the trip started so he had to sit this one out. So we invited Tony Neyer (etnies flow), Sean Sexton (Cinema), and Dakota Roche (Cinema) and rented an apartment in the Buckman neighborhood in Portland for 10 days. Shout out to Shawn \"Shitty\" McIntosh, Shad Johnson, Goods BMX and all the locals in Portland for their hospitality.\n\nFilmed & Edited by\nWill Stroud\nMusic:\nSong 1 - \"Intro (So Far So Real) by Crosby\nSong 2 - \"When We Was Kool\" by PPT\nSong 3 - \"Instant Nature\" by Gary Reynolds",
