    "description": "The simple thrill of the race defines the passion behind Ben Spies' approach to riding a motorcycle. From a very young age, Ben could hardly contain the excitement and emotion that emerged from seeing motorcycles accelerate around a track. Now, as he enters into his second season of Moto GP, Ben reflects back on his rise up through AMA and World Superbike racing. While embracing that childhood enthusiasm and channeling his desire for greatness, there is no doubt that Ben Spies is aiming to make history in the upcoming 2011 Moto GP season.\n\n\nJoin us as we take an exclusive look into the mind of a world-class racer.\n\nMusic: Laissez-moi passer\/NO",
