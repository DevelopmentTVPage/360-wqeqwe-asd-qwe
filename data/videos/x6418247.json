    "description": "With just enough direction, the team manages to meet up with Zarosh Eggleston in the sticks of Central California. An hour of dirt roads later, and they're at his ranch enjoying his DIY spot, the relaxed lifestyle, and the local watering hole. The crew grabs some speed runs on an access road to a very wealthy community not keen on skateboarding, and takes a dip before the pilgrimage north begins again.\nMany thanks to Zarosh Eggleston, and the awesome community of Cachagua.\nAppearances by James Kelly, Kody Noble, Duke Degen, Casey Morrow, Max Myers, Jimmy Riha, Eric Singer, Tyler Howell, Adam Crigler, and Kelly Carter.\nCheck out Arbor everywhere:\narborcollective.com",
