    "description": "Professional snowboarder and Arnette ambassador, Todd Richards, breaks down how the A.C.E.S. system works on the new Dibs & Moolah frames.\n\nNever heard of A.C.E.S.? A.C.E.S. stands for Arnette Creative Exchange System. Arnette has always stood for doing things your own way and to have fun doing it. With A.C.E.S., you have the ability to express yourself by offering customizing your sunglasses to match your style preference whenever you want.\n\nThe Dibs is a classic throwback to the era of hotrods, greasers, rumbles and pinups. It is a large, aggressive, squared-off 6-base frame that features an extra set of interchangeable arms so that you can customize your style for any occasion.\n\nThe Moolah is a vintage-inspired frame that lets the world know that you are the master of your own style destiny. It has timeless, 6-base round unisex style with tons of retro flavor.\n\nThe arms on the A.C.E.S. Dibs and Moolah are interchangeable with eachother, giving you even more options to mix and match as your mood changes.",
