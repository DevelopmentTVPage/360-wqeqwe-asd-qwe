I believe music has the power to communicate emotion, recording music is simply a process of packaging these feelings, so that when an audience listens to the music, they are immersed in them. Pursuing high quality sound and music is a lifelong mission for us as musicians. When I recorded my new album, I was doing things that hadn't been done before. It's an unprecedented album, recorded in 3D, meant to be listened to on headphones. When I was mastering the album, I was working on headphones. You should also wear headphones in order to hear the full 3D sound. If I can feel the music, then I'm sure  listeners will feel it too. \n[Music Playing]",
