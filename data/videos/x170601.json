    "description": "Brooklyn trio Widowspeak were firmly established by the time they headed to Austin, but their gorgeous brand of retro-leaning indie rock garnered a ton of new fans across their many shows. Anchored by guitarist and vocalist Molly Hamilton and guitarist Robert Earl Thomas, the band played a gorgeous rendition of \"The Dark Age\" - before going hiking (and swimming!) and generally getting dirty on a beautiful day in Texas.",
