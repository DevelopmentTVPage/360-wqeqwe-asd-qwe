    "description": "The volume was turned up to 11 at Slim's on night 4 of Converse Represent San Francisco. Hot Lunch, Saviours and High on Fire gave the night a roaring start before co-headliners Mastodon, and NYC vets Quicksand hit the stage. Playing their classic track \"Fazer\" to hardcore fans -- the band gave a window into why they are so beloved.\n\nThe Converse San Francisco store is now open. Come check it out at 838 Market St!",
