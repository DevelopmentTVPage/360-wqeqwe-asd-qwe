    "title": "Arbor Skateboards :: Adam Crigler x The Catalyst",
    "description": "With a home base in New York City, Adam Crigler is no stranger to urban longboard skating. From flatground to downhill, he is arguably the most well rounded longboard skater on the team. His board of choice, the Catalyst, matches his style with the ability to do a bit of everything well.\nIn the video (film\/edit Nate Shute), Adam brings his talents to West Coast showing us how longboarding in Venice can be as diverse as the people living there. From hills to dancing, this video has it all.\nTo see more of Arbor Skateboards visit: \narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
