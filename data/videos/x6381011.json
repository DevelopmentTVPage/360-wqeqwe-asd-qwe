    "description": "For a two week period in October, Converse took over three floors of an abandoned textile factory to create the second CONS Space with skaters, sculptors and live-in artists.\n\nThe ground floor Skate Lab featured sculptures designed by Roberto Cuellar, who took textural design influence from the former use of the space. During the many skate sessions that all the Berlin locals got to enjoy Converse Ambassadors Mike Anderson, Jason Jessee, Kenny Anderson, Javier Mendizabal, Remy Taviera and Danny Sommerfeld shot with local skate filmer Mark Nickels who put together this edit highlighting some of the fun that went down during those two weeks. \n\nMusic: The Parrots 'Gigantic Trees'",
