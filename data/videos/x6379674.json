    "title": "SPY Presents: Outta the Hood w\/ Shane Bonifay + The Dirk",
    "description": "The SPY crew made their way to Florida before the dawn of wake season to catch-up with Shane Bonifay in his 'hood. The venue wound-up moving miles away from Shane's stomping grounds of Orlando to Clermont, and the agenda switched from pre-season biz to mandatory good times on and off the water. Always easy to kick-off the season's planning session with a couple boats, good friends, a mindset bent on fun and cool people cheering our boy Shane on.",
