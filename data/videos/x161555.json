    "description": "We were searching through some tapes and just found the footage of Bruce Irons and Dean Morrison were on the Gold Coast for the first WCT of the year (The Quik Pro). Volcom surf corpo, Doug Herty filmed the boys while he was perched high above Snapper on the 13th floor of the Rainbow Bay Apartments, and on top of the headland at D'bah. The action is hot and the footage is shaky - but that's what you get with no tripod and a cold VB in your hand.",
