    "description": "The RMSS Tour just stopped in beautiful Pismo Beach, CA. The best waves we've seen thus far greeted the 50 groms on the South side of the Pismo Pier. And yes, we know we keep claiming the waves get better at every stop, but we swear it has really been the case. No joke. We've gone all the way from toe-to-ankle high Deerfield Beach, FL to rippable head-high peaks here in Pismo. And if this trend keeps up it looks like we'll be finishing up next week in Oceanside with some grinding double overhead barrels. But don't worry, we're sure the mini groms will still be ready to show up and charge when that happens. Click into the story for full highlights and photos from RMSS Pismo Beach. \n\nPhotos\/video: PK.",
