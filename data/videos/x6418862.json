    "description": "Last Week-End in Biarritz, O'Neill and one of our Partner Surf club, the BASCS, run a new edition of the \"T\u00e9tards\" Surf contest. The oldest and most Authentic European kids surf contest (-14 only). It was all about dedication to surfing and new generations, fun and progression. The kids have been blessed by the return of the swell on the French coast and the 3 feet waves were looking double overhead for those little rippers... More than 160 groms showed up to participate to this annual up-coming generations rendezvous. The level was incredibly high and the kids from 6 to 14 years old offered us a pretty impressive show: airs, huge turns, reverses, the whole bag of tricks was there. Enjoy the fun.",
