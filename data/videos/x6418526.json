    "description": "The RMSS Middletown, RI stop greeted us with fun, 2-3ft waves and plenty of excited kids ready to surf. Eventual RMSS winner Emma Leach put on an incredible display of hula-hoop surfing, while the rest of our finalists kept the beach equally as entertained. Our pro crew was on hand to help the younger surfers, and even got in the mix themselves trying out the hula hoops and participating in the dance competition. We can't wait to see you next year Middletown! \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",
