    "description": "The Buffalo Bills and The Buffalo Sabres are sports teams based out of Buffalo, NY but the American Buffalo is a the state animal of the 10th most extensive, but least populous, and second least densely populated of the 50 United States, which just so happens to be called Wyoming. What does this all have in common you ask? At first glance, nothing. But upon further examination\u2026still nothing. Nonetheless, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Arbor team visited this Bighorned, Tetoned state during the winter of 2014, saw some of these giant, beautiful Buffalo, did some backcountry boarding, and bagged some banger backside bombholes. Don\u2019t believe me? Just watch the video.",
