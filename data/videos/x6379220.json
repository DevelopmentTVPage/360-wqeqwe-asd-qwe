    "description": "Hailing from Long Beach, California and known as \"Juju\" to the closest of his bros, there's really not one bad thing you can say about Julian Davidson. At his core Julian is 100% skateboarder with a timeless style in everything that he does, from the impeccable kick flips on flat you can see any day of the week cruising by Cherry Park, to going big on rails and stair sets whilst out on a filming mission, the majority of skaters would borrow Julian's skating any day of the week. In addition to his natural talent, he is also one of the most humble, generous and respectful dudes around that would not think twice to give you the shirt off his back. Quietly one of the most determined skaters on stunt wood, Julian Davidson is a classic in the making.\nSee more of Julian: etnies.com\/team\/skate\/julian-davidson",
