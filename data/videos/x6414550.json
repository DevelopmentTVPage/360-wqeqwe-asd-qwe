    "description": "Its Festival period and the bus is off to Somersault festival in North Croyde- Castle Hill. High tide acoustic sessions, workshops by Ben Skinner and night screenings by the river from O'Neill while Ben Howard and Jack Johnson were sharing some great vibes on the main stage. \nRight after the bus was roadtriping towards Bude for Leopallooza festival. The biggest house party in a field. Great atmosphere, good bands and an awesome show at the Jack Gear FMB Invitational. Parked by the mini ramp we had a blust at the bus playing some more tunes at the high tide acoustic sessions and doing some more night screenings under the stars.\nNext stop is boardmasters and the Mount Hawke one of the oldest skates parks in the country in which Ben Skinner is introducing as to Surf-Skate. See you on the road.",
