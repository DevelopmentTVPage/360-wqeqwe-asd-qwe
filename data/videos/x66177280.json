You can't get in the ring and think oh this guy is going to beat me just 'cause he got couple pounds on me.\"\n\"Work, let's work, move that ground, come on, punch punch.\"\n\"I've been defeated, I've been job broke, I've been down, I got that on my side. I know there is light, I've lit it. No, way for me to lose, I'm the fastest, I'm the most scientific, I'm the most creative, I'm the most artistic, I have the prettiest foot work, prettiest face they'll never be another fighter like me and I'm here to prove it.\"\n\"It's just another day at the office, it's just another guy right in front of you.\"\n\"I don't want to be a regular person, definitely I want to be a regular person who like'd to leave a legacy.\"\n\"I shook up the world.\"\n\"Muhammad Ali is not from my generation but I remember him. That is what I want.\"\n\"You're tired, you're tired, deep breath.\"\n\"i'm not tired. I am not tired.\"\n\"Be among those who dare to dare.\"",
