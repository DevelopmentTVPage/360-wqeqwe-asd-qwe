    "transcripts": "What's going on world, my name is Jesse Boykins III and I'm here with Beats by Dre shwozale. The uh project's called Bartholomew it's about a character that I came up with in my head he's pretty eclectic so he thinks he works for NASA secretly and he also thinks that he's one of the Lost Boys from Peter Pan you can also call him Harry Shwozale Fontay you know uh and pretty much he's ok with being in the friend zone that's the main thing he's ok. So all the songs are pretty much written from his uh points of views. Right now I have a song, I've done a song with Isaiah Rashad. Uh Dej-lo she's a fan of mine we actually did a record recently I sold an album as well, that's pretty cool. A couple other people you know I'm keeping to myself. Sonically when I started thinking about what I want to do actually I didn't really think about it this go around like I usually do. When I moved to LA I just started working with everyone who asked me to work with them. South or Radinski, Machine Jerome, Chrome Sparks, musicians who really appreciate the concept o film score. I never worked with so many different people on one project and when I thought about it I was just like that's too much, like not stressful, but it was just the most probably free flowing I've ever had created. The more open you are then the more like the more depth you can find of yourself as far as what you can express.",
