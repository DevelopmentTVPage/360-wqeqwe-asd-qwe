The SPY + Ken Block Helm feature custom-color arm variations in the Signature Series\u2014which can be snapped-on and--off and mixed-and-matched\u2014are further punctuated with asymmetrical tip colors on the left temple, inspired by Block's mismatched wheel color and single-spoke accents on his 650-horsepower, 2.0-liter H.F.H.V. Ford Fiesta's Gymkhana setup for 2012. Every pair of shades comes with a free bonus set of temples. The frames also feature mirrored lenses in a multitude of colors that help complete the throwback story, echoing a swagger that pervaded American fashion through the '70s and '80s.",
