    "transcripts": "We are here today with Rolling Stones, for Ray-Ban 75th anniversary shoot, sporting some good eye wear. For me I thought instantly about the 60\u2019s mods scene because I\u2019m a huge fan of uh fine tailored suits, skinny tie, that whole look. And for me you know I thought it was like a perfect time period to kind of capture the kind of style that I personally love. We\u2019ve always been incredibly conscious about the connection between the way we dress on stage and the music. Everything about Fitz & the Tantrums live shows is extraordinary from the way we perform the songs to the way we dress on stage. Our music has a lot of influences from the Motown and stax period of soul music. As well as kind of mixing in some of the 80\u2019s British invasion bands with a little bit of hip hop, and indie rock all sort of put in the blender you get Fitz & the Tantrums. We got off uh crazy year and a half of non stop touring, and we literally came home, and went right into the studio trying to write the next record. We\u2019re going to be doing coachella this year, bonnaroo, uh ton of summer festivals. Hey everybody this is Fitz from Fitz & the Tantrums and I am wishing Ray-Ban Happy 75th anniversary as you know I like these glasses. [Music Playing].",
