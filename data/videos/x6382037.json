    "description": "Santa Cruz Skateboards catches up with street veteran and 80's legend, Tom Knox, in his home town of Visalia Ca. Tom talks about turning pro for Santa Cruz and skates the spots he shredded in his classic video part from Speed Freaks. Including the spot where he did the first kickflip wallride in history! Checkout Tom's first pro deck, his newest school of Jujitsu in between new clips of him skating and more!\n\n***If you don\u2019t see your original comments below it\u2019s because we had to delete the original video and re-upload it. The original upload had a processing error that made the footage super contrasty and blown out and that ain\u2019t cool. Thanks, and feel free to share your comments again below!",
