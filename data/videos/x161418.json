    "description": "What's better then a cold day in Quebec city? Rhetorical question, it's obviously a crisp sunny bluebird day of shredding at Mont Avila in QC. Stop #4 and Canada's first stop of Volcom's Peanut Butter Rail Jam took place on January 21, 2012. \n\nNow, when we say 'Peanut Butter and Rail Jam', you think 'rail jam' or delicious snack. Food aside, that's what the Mont Avila Park served up. A feast fit for a king. The contest plate was healthy combination of long barrels and down bars, pared with a delicious stair-set combined with rainbow rail goodness.\n\n\nResults: \n\n15 & Under Winners:\n1st Place: Joel Massariol\n2nd Place: Felix Patry\n3rd Place: Karim Lachapelle\n4th Place: Keenan Gibson\n5th Place: Louis Felix Robert\n\n16 & Over Winners:\n1st Place: Alexandre Desjardins\n2nd Place: Danick Godbout\n3rd Place: Paul Antoine\n4th Place: Charles Auge Pouliot\n5th Place: Nicolas Leduc\nGirls Division Winners:\n1st Place: Melissa Rodrigue\n2nd Place: Camille Bellavance\n3rd Place: Marjorie Couturier\n4th Place: Marey Chase\n5th Place: Natasha Herbert\n\nOpen Division Winners:\n1st Place: Diego Guerrero\n2nd Place: Dillion Ojo\n3rd Place: Axel Theoret\n4th Place: Jacques-Olivier Emond\n5th Place: Alex Ganthier\n\nElectric \"Gooeyest Move of the Day\":\nAlel Theoret\n\n- Music -\nSong: \"No Fool\"\nArtist: Fait Accompli",
