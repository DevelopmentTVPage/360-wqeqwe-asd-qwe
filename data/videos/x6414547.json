    "description": "The O'Neill bus is still on the road. On this episode we are spending some time at Boardmasters where Ben(1st), Adam(2nd) and Sam(4th) all make it to the podium. Next stop is the Skinpup's surf & skate day hosted by Ben Skinner at the legendary Mount Hawke skatepark. Lots of smiles, great vibes, bbq, giveaways and some pretty damn good skating. After a couple of days in Mt Hawke and the swell going flat we dropped by our good friends at Shorewater sports in Wittering having a great night and a day full of activities and laughs.\nThe summer road trip is coming to an end and the O'Neill bus is heading in the big city. Stay tuned for the next and last episode of the Today Is Perfect Roadtrip.",
