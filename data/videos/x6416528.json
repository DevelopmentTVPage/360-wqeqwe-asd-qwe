    "description": "The System is a design platform that delivers a cleaner ride without forfeiting edge performance. The System improves both rocker and camber shapes, without hybridizing the two together, which we think sacrifices the inherent benefits of each. The System design eliminates the leverage required to release and re-engage a snowboard\u2019s outside contact points, while creating a highly effective, more direct connection to the snow.\nArbor now offers two full lines of its System design. Each is the result of blending Grip Tech with a Parabolic Profile:\nThe System Rocker design provides a surfy ride, with natural float and cleaner tracking.\nThe System Camber design offers a poppy ride, with crisp, fully engaged performance.\nGrip Tech is a tri-radial sidecut design that is not \u201cblended.\u201d Natural shaping intersections, that in the past were eliminated, have been transformed into heel-and-toe contact points that provide a direct, more ergonomic way to grip the snow when additional control is needed. The extra contacts also form pivot zones that make turning easier and more natural. Grip Tech effectively moves a board\u2019s primary interface with the snow underfoot, allowing us to deliver designs that don\u2019t lose performance as we lift leading sections of the effective edge from the snow for a less grabby ride. Those designs include rocker, or camber with our new Uprise Fenders.\n\nUprise Fenders pull the outside contact zones off the snow with angled 3 degree risers on all System Camber designs\nThe System utilizes rocker and camber profiles created using the parabolic arc, which progressively reduces the amount of rocker or camber toward the tip and tail of a snowboard, creating nice low profiles. On our System Rocker designs, this ensures that the outside contact points are close enough to the snow to engage when maximum performance is required \u2013 higher speeds, fully loaded turns, and bigger landings. On System Camber designs, this guarantees that the outside contact points do not dig too far into the snow, creating a cleaner, less catchy performance that makes it easier to turn, spin, and ride fast.",
