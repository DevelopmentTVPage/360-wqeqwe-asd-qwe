    "description": "Shop the Talent Scout Collection: etni.es\/04r3\n\nThe Talent Scout Artist Series is a collaborative footwear and apparel collection featuring the works of six different artists from a variety of mediums, genres and backgrounds. Each artist designed an etnies Scout colorway along with t-shirts to compliment the footwear, creating a comprehensive artistic showcase.\nNicomi Nix Turner was raised in Southern Oregon. The Pacific Northwest upbringing kindled an affinity for the botanical and entomological. Her hyper-detailed illustrations invoke a surreal understanding of the perfection in nature while capturing the cycle of death coexisting with life and not just decay.\n\"For this collaboration I wanted to integrate life, death and powerful beasts into one story. Each piece has a certain mythos tied to it: The Tiger with the skull connects this strong beast with the strength of man, The Ram skull plays home to serpents and vegetation and the Two Skulls support the connectivity to life and death.\"",
