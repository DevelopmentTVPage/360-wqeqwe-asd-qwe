    "description": "The second stop of the 2016 Rip Curl GromSearch series presented by Banzai Bowls made its annual visit to Kewalo Basin, on the South Shore of Oahu.  Those who entered the event made a great decision as near perfect 3-5 foot A-frames consistently poured into the lineup all day long. With a GromSearch single day record of 100 competitors entered into the draw, the day was an all-out shredfest to see who reigned supreme. \n\nVideo: Willie Edwards\n\nOFFICIAL RESULTS FROM STOP #2 OF THE RIP CURL GROMSEARCH PRESENTED BY BANZAI BOWLS\n\nBoys 16 & Under\n1.
