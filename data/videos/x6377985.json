    "description": "The Arbor Backlash is a new board for 2013. It features a truly functional kicktail on a body set up for speed.\nThe design uses 24\" of rocker through the center of the platform. Flush-mounted truck mounts maintain proper turning angle while lowering your ride to give you superior slide control. This board also features a 3\" kick to catch your front foot on ollies or launch ramp tricks.\nNo limits - bomb, flip, slide - whatever.\nL: 39.75\"\nW: 9.75\"\nWB: 24.00\"-26.625\"\nThe 2013 Backlash features a Hawaiian Koa bottom sheet with art by Eric Waetzig.\nRider: Tyler Howell\n\nCheck out Arbor Skateboards everywhere:\narborcollective.com\/skateboards",
