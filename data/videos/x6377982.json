The Axis has a symmetrical snowboard inspired shape that offers quick rail-to-rail performance, with drop-through mounting for a more ergonomic push and power through turns and slides.\n\nL: 40.00\"\nW: 9.00\"\nWB: 30.00\"\n\nThe Axis comes with a Hawaiin Koa topsheet with art by Matt Smith, a Bamboo topsheet with art by Nanami Cowdroy, a Walnut topsheet with art by Patrick Vaughan, and a Griptape topsheet with art by Zach Johnsen.\n\nCheck out the Axis here:\nKoa -- arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/409922\/axis\nBamboo -- arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/409923\/axis-bamboo\nWalnut -- arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/483961\/axis-walnut\nGriptape -- arborcollective.com\/skate\/boards\/view\/426738\/axis-gt\n\nCheck out Arbor everywhere:\narborcollective.com",
