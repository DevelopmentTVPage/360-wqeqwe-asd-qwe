    "description": "\"SPY's connection to technical eyewear goes all the way back to the beginning of the Company, when we invented our anti-fogging technology, so the whole 'Performance' thing is an evolution of our heritage as much as it is about design or innovation,\" says Jeremy McGrath, 7-Time AMA Supercross Champion, SPY\u00ae founder and rider. \"We started out as California racers who did other sports, and that vibe is still what SPY is about today. If I don't have to wear goggles, whether it's mountain-biking or hitting golf balls or whatever, I'm wearing these glasses.\"\n\nThe SPY Performance\u2122 series features the SPY\u00ae-patented anti-fogging Scoop\u00ae venting system; virtually unbreakable Grilamid\u2122 frames; impact-resistant, optically-correct and distortion-free ARC\u00ae (Accurate Radius Curve) lenses; glare-reducing Premium Trident\u2122 polarized infusion in select models; bounce-back glare-diffusing lens coating; anti-scratch and hydrophobic and oleophobic technology; environmentally reactive Hytrel\u2122 rubber nose pads and temple tips; and UVA, UVB and UVC protective treatments.\n\n\"My Alphas stay on my face and stay clear, which is important when up and down can be a little foggy,\" muses Mike Montgomery, freestyle mountain bike rider. \"Seriously, these are the only glasses I'd wear when it matters. They look sick too, so you don't look like a kook off the bike.\"\n\nMSRP for the Quanta\u2122 is $100 to $140, which are available in translucent black, matte black, matte black polarized, shiny black, translucent brown and matte white frame colors. Replacement Quanta\u2122 lenses come in select colors and range from $20 for non-polarized to $40 for polarized versions.\n\nThe Alpha\u2122, the lighter-weight, streamlined, semi-rimless installment in the SPY Performance\u2122 line, have an MSRP of $120 to $160, and come in shiny black, matte black, metallic silver and translucent brown frame styles with corresponding grey, blue Spectra\u2122 mirror, black mirror, rose with blue mirror, yellow or bronze lenses, or polarized grey or black mirror lenses. Additional lenses in select colors for the Alpha\u2122 also range from $20 to $40.\nFor additional information about SPY Performance\u2122, go to www.spyoptic.com\/performance.
