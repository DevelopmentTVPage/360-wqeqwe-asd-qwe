    "description": "At first, Alaska doesn't sound much like a surf destination but this is just a matter of perception. The O'Neill team rider and adventurer, Damien Castera, sees it all the way around. For him the Last Frontier means empty lines ups and perfect waves but not only. Alaska is also about a back into the wild experience, Damien spent 2 month there surfing and hiking on self-sufficiency: fishing for food, rough encampment for accommodation and pepper sprays as self-defense against bears or any other wild life you can encounter there... Check out this flick which gives you a beautiful overview of what Damien's has been experiencing for 60 days.",
