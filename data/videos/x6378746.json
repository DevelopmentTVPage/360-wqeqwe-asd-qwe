This year the crew was made up of Scotty Lago, Tim Humphreys, Dylan Thompson and joining them with support from Mike Skiba and Kyle Kennedy. \n\nMt Hood this year was like nothing the crew had seen before. With the lack of snow over the winter the Windells Diggers were faced with a  huge challenge over the summer and really came through with a fun flowy park for the Neff Session. Back at camp, Neff came through again with the biggest Ice Cream party of the summer. Campers loaded up on Ice Cream served by Lago, Tim and Dylan and had a buffet of toppings to satisfy any campers sugar crave. Check out the FUN in the latest summer edit\u2026\n\nVideo: Wojciech Targosz",
