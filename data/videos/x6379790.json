    "description": "Some video action of SURFER Poll award winner and aerial innovator, Josh Kerr, boosting above the lip out in the water. The Kerrazy man is always having fun in the surf and he definitely fits the Arnette vibe. We're stoked to have this Aussie as a part of the crew!\n\nJosh is rockin' the Cold One in this clip, which is part of our Arnette Creative Exchange System (A.C.E.S.) series of shades. All of the pieces in our A.C.E.S. collection come with interchangeable parts so you can change up your style whenever the mood strikes you. \n\nCheck out www.arnette.com",
