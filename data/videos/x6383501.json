    "description": "The Mosh is the gateway to freeride bliss, and Sperman Splunt just can\u2019t help getting the word out to everyone. It\u2019s midsize profile and round lips make it a perfect wheel for any type of freeride, whether you\u2019re just learning or a seasoned slide addict, and it\u2019s quick acceleration means you\u2019re ready to do slide after slide. The centerset core lets you flip these to wear evenly, and get the most bang for your buck.\nThe Mosh weighs in at 65mm tall, with a 36mm contact patch and no core offset. It comes in 82a in all five colors.\nThe Sucrose Initiative was developed to bring together rider based design, performance across a wide range of conditions, and an effort to start reducing our reliance on petroleum based materials. Our highly durable Sucrose urethane makes these wheels the best performing and most cost efficient lift ticket on the hill, and with 10% less petroleum content, you can feel good about making a conscious choice to reduce our impact on the environment.\nCheck out the whole lineup of Sucrose Initiative wheels at: arborcollective.com\/skateboards\/products\/wheels\/\nRiders: Norman Plante, Cooper Darquea, Will Clay\nFilm\/Edit: Tom Flinchbaugh",
