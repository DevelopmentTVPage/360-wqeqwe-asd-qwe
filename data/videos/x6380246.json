    "description": "On a 5 day filming trip for our full length movie, Tick Tock, grom rider Ryan Pluche took a gnarly little spill on this crazy double-kink\/wall ride combo feature. It is tough to watch, but luckily, he walked away from this one with just some hardcore bruising and soreness.\n\nIt was his birthday as well, and he was able to eventually stack a shot on the feature. Stay tuned for more video updates from the video project and our last trip.\n\nfreestyleusa.com\/team\/blog\/",
