    "description": "Maybe it's the impressive beards. Maybe it's the deep, raspy voices with the soulful undertones -- but whatever it is, listening to \"Rich Folk\" makes us feel like we're getting life advice from someone a lot wiser than us. It's music to listen to with a fire and an old photo album. But enough with all this emotional nonsense; press play to get to know our favorite folk band during a recent recording session at the Hurley music studio.",
