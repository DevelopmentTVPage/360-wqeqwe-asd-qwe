So uh are you going to ask me about my movie? Interview me or anything? Um well I was actually hoping this would be about my movie. Oh right right, well what's your movie about again? Um it's called soul surfer, and it's about my life, um I'm a surfer and I lost my arm to a shark, right. When I was like 13, 13 that's young. And then yeah, and then I made a come, I made a comeback and continued surfing and just about the journey of that, and it's exciting! Sounds inspiring, yes. I just um you know I thought about surfing myself, but from getting from one place to the other, but I just decided you know why not just take a ship. I think your dreads might get catch on the reef. Oh really? Yeah, and that could be bad. I always thought that was always the oceans kind of thing, but I guess you're right. I don't want like a fish stuck in here or pieces of coral. Well you know what, I think we should go see it. Yeah definitely, lets go! Oh wait it's this way, it's this way. Oh no wait, oh no wait, no it's actually this way. [Music Playing].",
