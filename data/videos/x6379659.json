    "description": "This past weekend Mt. High gave everyone the winter itch with their annual \"Season Pass Party\". The weather was as far from winter as I think you can get, 90 degree temperatures and dry with a back drop of just gigantic cumulonimbus clouds waiting to strike down with the thunder of gods and the lightening from heaven. Throughout the day there were raffles, product tosses, live music, chair lift rides up the mountain, kisses from Smelly and of course a bikini contest. The winner of the bikini contest won a season pass, as well as a huge gift bag filled with all the goodies one would need to shred the snowy slopes.",
