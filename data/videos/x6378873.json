    "description": "US Open of Surfing has always been a wild week, but this year was unlike any other year to date. With Neff as the Official Eyewear Sponsor and bringing talents like Sexy Sax Man and Mr. Neff, Huntington Beach received an all out Neff invasion. \n\nKids lined up 300 deep for a chance to spin the Neff Wheel. Understandable when Neff was dishing out prizes like pairs of their Neff Vision shades along with many other prizes and swag. \n\nOn the final Saturday of the event Neff headed up to JACK'S SURFSHOP for a signing with their entire Surf Team. Jordy Smith, Kolohe Andino, Dion Agius and Evan Geiselman. To ensure the signing was a complete mad-house Neff recruited Warren-G, Dirt Nasty and Cisco Adler to join the signing. Over 1000 people waited in line to get their poster's autographed.",
