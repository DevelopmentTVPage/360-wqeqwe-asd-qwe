    "transcripts": "Snapper rocks contest was going on so I was down more above Kirra. It was relatively happy and I just remember seeing it  and going oh my gosh there's nobody really around and it's coming from the deep you kind of know you're going to get a good one. It was a wide swinger so it looked like a closeout but those are the ones that you want because it hits the bank and then you just run with it. I remember pumping in one time and then going through the other section and then seeing another section coming. You just keep going, it's amazing wave.",
