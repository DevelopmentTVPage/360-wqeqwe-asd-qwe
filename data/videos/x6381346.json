    "description": "Element is proud to introduce the Burley\u2019s, inspired, tested, and approved by Donny Barley. \u201cBuilt Burly, like Barley.\u201d \n\nThe Burley Chino has been carefully crafted to embody the timeless style and endurance of Element legend, and East Coast Powerhouse, Donny Barley. \n\nFirst released in 1999, Element and Donny Barley introduced the \u201cBurley\u201d, the first chino with flex. Born out of necessity, with his blue-collar, east-coast approach to skateboarding; Donny was tearing through traditional work-wear chinos and needed something to withstand the daily grind. The \u201cBurley\u201d pant combined thick, durable fabric with flexibility, finally something that could endure Barley.\n\nTaking feedback from both Barley and the new generation of Element riders, the Burley has now been re-built from the ground up using our patented 11 0z Element Work Flex fabric, reinforced with resin for extra durability, and designed with a contemporary straight fit. The new Burley continues to embody the classic work-wear aesthetic, built to endure the elements and harsh climates of the East Coast, and withstand all of the qualities demanded for intense skateboarding. \n\nThe Burley\u2019s are Element\u2019s optimum skateboard pant.",
