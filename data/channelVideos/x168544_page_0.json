Part of a rare breed that rides equally well in the streets, the backcountry, and the park, Sollors is the definition of an all around rider. This urban gap stood out in his part for its sheer size, high risk, and huge mandatory drop. With a run-in on a mere smattering of snow, adjusting the approach angle was tricky, and coming in blind didn't make this any easier for Mark. A heavy dose of dedication, and a handful of tries, earned Mark this monster clip.",

But we can at least dispel one rumor for you: non-Burton bindings do indeed fit on a Burton board featuring The Channel. While it's true that when The Channel first released it only worked with Burton bindings, recent developments have opened up the versatility, adjustability, and convenience of The Channel to other binding brands as well.\n\nWith the help of a couple Burton Knowbuddies: Brady Lem and Tommy Gesme, and the trusty Burton Demo Center employees: Connor Manning and Dave Massie, we set out to prove once and for all that The Channel works with just about any binding out there.",
