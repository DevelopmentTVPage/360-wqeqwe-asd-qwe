            "description": "Captain Phantom (aka Zach Hartley) has been crashing Surf PE classes up and down the Southern California coast with a van full of new Hurley Surfboards to pass out for kids to demo. Monday morning, he was at it again. Said the Cap'n: \"We just wrapped up another great Surf Demo with 25+ kids from Carlsbad High School. When we rolled into the parking lot at Tamarack on Monday morning almost all the kids in the class were already suited up, waiting to demo the boards. Everyone was all smiles, and there seemed to be lots of interest around the boards (from kids and parents). The entire Surf PE class left the beach wearing their new Hurley beanies, and as we were about to leave, the whole group yelled, 'Thank You!' Really amazing stuff.\" Video: PK",

The 19-year-old beat San Clemente local and former World Tour surfer, Tanner Gudauskas, by .06, netting himself a $70,000 payday between the $40,000 winner's check and the trophy valued at $30,000. But it was the 6,500 points he earned with the win that the Brazilian coveted most, boosting him to No. 29 in the world, which puts him inside the cut off when the World Tour reshuffles at the season's midpoint. Said Miggy: \"I'm just so happy. I was thinking just about the points when I first got here, and this is great to win this event going into the next PRIME in Brazil. It's my dream to make the World Tour and these points will help.\" Video: Tom Aiello",

            "description": "A lack of rideable surf didn't stop our 80 competitors from having the most fun they possibly could have during today's RMSS stop in Deerfield Beach, Florida. And although you wouldn't think it, the flat conditions made for some of the most creative surfing the tour has ever seen -- everything from chair rides, to cartwheels, to 15-second-long headstands. The judges had their had their hands full with all the great action in the water, but in the end it was little Jordan Rosenholtz taking home the win and Jack Koras coming in a close second (side note: for both Jordan and Jack, it was their first time on a surfboard -- very impressive). A big thanks goes out to Cheyne Cottrell and the crew from Island Water Sports for helping us dodge the golf-ball-sized hail during the afternoon slideshow and retail event and also for their huge help in the morning's surf contest. We can't wait for next year! \n\nVideo: PK",
