The three trick clip submissions need to include one trick at each of the three spots.\n\nThe 8000\u20ac winner will be announced at the Three Streets To Berlin Boat Party on Thursday 29 June, at the Hopetosse, located next to the Bright tradeshow.\nEntries are limited, sign up early.\n\nChristian Vankelst, Volcom skate team manager Europe:\n\u201cI am super excited on this fresh contest format, and looking forward on the action that will go down!

There\u2019s no one-minute-run stress or jam session hassle; you get to discover the Berlin city vibes and everyone can get an update of the action simply by following the hashtag on their phones!

            "description": "Banzai Pipeline, North Shore, Oahu, HAWAII \u2013 (Friday, January 29, 2016) -- The morning fired out continuous barrels as Round 1 of the Volcom Pipe Pro got underway in clean 8-10 foot surf and light offshore easterly winds. The second World Surf League (WSL) Hawaii Qualifying Series (QS) event of the season, the Volcom Pipe Pro offers a $100,000 prize purse, up to 3,000 regional ratings points, and a slot into the Pipe Invitational with the potential of advancing into the Billabong Pipe Masters, the final stop of the WSL Championship Tour.\n \nOne of the youngest competitors of the event, Maui\u2019s Imaikalani deVault, 18, advanced behind North Shore mainstay Kai Mana Henry, 37, with a combined heat total of a 6.90.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty nerve wracking but it\u2019s so cool,\u201d deVault said about surfing against top Pipeline competitors. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Kai Mana (Henry) surf out here since I was like five years old so to surf a heat with him is just like, dream come true for sure.\u201d\n \nThe teen is working to qualify into the QS6,000 events at the end of the year and talked about the benefit of competing here in the islands.\n \n\u201cBeing from Hawaii is definitely an advantage because you can get into events like this or the Triple Crown\u2026 just to get practice out here when other people can\u2019t, it\u2019s just a huge opportunity to be able to be in this contest and I\u2019m super happy.\u201d\n \nKoa Smith (HAW), 21, was the standout competitor of the event so far, wowing the beach crowd with back to back nine\u2019s - a 9.0 and a 9.67 - the two highest wave scores of the day. Smith stormed his heat against Kiron Jabour (HAW), Noa Mizuno (HAW) and Kaito Ohashi (JPN) and used prime positioning to his advantage.\n \n\u201cI saw that set coming and I got myself into position,\u201d said Smith. \u201cKiron paddled for that first wave so it kind of put me more into position, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh are you going,\u2019 and I was paddling up the face like, \u2018Oh I don\u2019t know,\u2019 and then I was just perfectly in the right spot. From there I just relaxed through it and had a couple sketchy chandeliers but it let me out and as soon as I got back out the next wave came. And I was just like \u2018okay that was fun.\u2019\u201d\n \nThe wildcards of the event included Volcom team riders Gavin Beschen (HAW) and Balaram Stack (USA), who both got a spot in Round 3, while North Shore\u2019s Koa Rothman (HAW), 22, earned his berth into the Round of 96 by besting the 6-man Volcom Qualifier heat against Tom Dosland, Kawai Lindo, JD Irons, Dave Wassel and Derek Ho. The highest score of the heat \u2013 an 8.33 \u2013 saw Rothman win the third wildcard slot into the competition.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m pretty stoked, I didn\u2019t have enough points to get into the event any other way, so Volcom gave me a shot and it ended up working out really well,\u201d said Rothman. \u201cI think it was probably some of the best Pipe surfers in the world, but I ended up pulling through.\u201d\n \nMyles Padaca, who placed second at the Sunset Pro last Sunday, advanced through his heat in first place ahead of Allen Schuyler, Travis Beckmann and Ezra Sitt. The 44-year-old will surf again once the competition resumes.\n \nBruce Irons advanced to Round 3 after a nail biting heat with Torrey Meister (HAW), Makuakai Rothman (HAW) and Seth Moniz (HAW). Rothman and Moniz had the lead for the majority of the 25-minute heat until Meister and Irons split a peak in the last ten seconds and scored a 5.27 and 7.17 respectively, which bumped them up to first and second place to advance.\n\nSong: Delta\nArtist: AlgernonCornelius\nCourtest of Instinctive Peoples",
