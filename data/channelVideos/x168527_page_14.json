They embarked in search of skate exploration and put this shoe's blend of strength and style to the test. What they discovered was stark. Slab City is what they found. Armed with power tools, bags of cement mix, and buckets of water, the crew stirred up some skate creation and managed to throw hammers in a desolate location.",

The etnies Marana was designed to blend strength and style, making it perfect for a Ryan Sheckler signature model. This shoe was carefully crafted, piece by piece, to endure skateboarding. Its fused-on injected rubber toe cap makes it super hard to wear through, the lightweight and impact-resistant STI Evolution\u2122 Foam midsole doesn't pack out, enhancing the cushioning of the Polyurethane footbed and the non-slip grip outsole's thick herringbone tread with deep grooves just doesn't wear down.\n\nMusic: Aer - Like the Way",
