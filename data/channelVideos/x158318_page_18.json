            "description": "Our Deerfield RMSS event was met with 96 excited kids ready to take on the micro 0-1ft waves on offer in Deerfield. Due to the small surf we encouraged the kids to get \"Innovative\" in order to advance to the next round. We saw gymnastic moves, headstands, dancing, belly flops, and yoga poses taking place on our big INT Softboards, and Riviera SUP boards. Our great team consisting of Pete Devries, AJ Collins, Taylor Pai, Mason Barnes, and Noah Snyder got in the bath-like 84 degree water to help propel the amped kids into some tiny waves. The event winner, Bella Miller, was actually on vacation from Canada, teaming up with fellow Canadian Peter Devries to take the RMSS crown back to our neighbors in the north. \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",

            "description": "We showed up to Folly Beach, SC and were promptly greeted by a 7 AM thunderstorm (this didn't seem to happen when we were back in Huntington Beach..). But when the clouds cleared, we scored the most fun waves of the whole tour thus far. There were 2-3ft fun peaks all over the washout, with some even bigger sets coming in at times. All the boys were frothing to get in the water, with Scotty Stopnik was seen KILLING it on a Roberts Mush Machine while Pete Devries ripped on a T. Patterson. Even Taylor Pai himself threw on some fins and bodysurfed into some closeouts. We had about 66 kids on hand, and there were great vibes all around with everyone having a good time. This could have been due to the great waves, but we think it is simply indicative of how rad the southern community is. AJ Collins and Mitch Abshere both remarked about the high level of southern hospitality. Special Thanks to Parrot Surf Shop!  \n\nVideo: Noah Snyder",

The kids were surfing well on their INT soft boards and Toys bodyboards, doing tandem rides, jousting, and playing games of surf chicken.
