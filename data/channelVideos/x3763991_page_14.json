With standout video parts in a plethora of influential snowboard films, Marie has solidified her spot among the most accomplished female riders in the field. She has been on top of the game for years and shows no signs of stopping. This past season Marie was awarded the title of Women\u2019s Rider of the Year and Women\u2019s Video Part of the Year at the 2015 Transworld Readers Poll Awards. These accolades mark the second time she has received these titles.\n\nBoth on and off the hill, Marie\u2019s synergies with Arbor are undeniable. Beyond her riding accomplishments, Marie is also one of the most influential advocates for sustainability and environmentalism in action sports. In 2014, Marie produced the award winning film \u201cThe Little Things\u201d, a movie project based on environmentally conscious riders who are inspirational through their riding, as well as their sustainable ways of thinking and living. The movie has received tremendous praise and led to Marie receiving the Climate Activist Award Presented by Protect Our Winters.\n\nDuring the winter, Marie lives in Whistler, BC where she has easy access to some of the world\u2019s best backcountry terrain. The summer months bring Marie to her eco-friendly home on Vancouver Island. She built the house with the help of her brother Alex and a community of friends. Constructed from natural and recycled materials, Marie\u2019s summerhouse is just one of the \u201clittle things\u201d that she does to live sustainably and in balance with our environment.\n\nSince 1995 Arbor has pioneered the use of sustainable materials in our snowboard production. When we look to the future, we cannot think of a better partner than someone with the ethos, passion, and experience of Marie-France Roy.",

This is our Returning Roots program. The effort has been centered on the Koa highlands of Hawaii. We see this as the best way to give back to the planet and culture that gave us riding in the first place. The native Hawaiians invented surfing as much as 1,000 years ago, on boards made from Koa wood. If you surf mountains, sidewalks, or swell \u2013 the Hawaiians get a nod of gratitude.\nThe Hawaiian Legacy Reforestation Initiative is our main Returning Roots partner today. This group is not just planting trees \u2013 they are rebuilding forests. By Spring 2015, they will have planted over 300,000 Koa trees on 800 acres of former forestland, with a full range of native understory plants to complete the ecosystem. The Hawaiian Legacy Reforestation Initiative is helping Arbor do our part in the restoration and protection of forests, while we strike an important balance with our use of sustainable sourced wood materials.\nThe Arbor Collective is a crew of friends with a range of approaches to what, why, and where to ride. Tying these diverse perspectives together is a shared respect for the environment. That connection is a huge part of why Arbor was founded, and continues to be a driving force at the brand today.",

Good times were had by all and the following video presents the long and short of what went down. Thanks to everyone that came out including but not limited to Erik Leon, Mike Gray, Jared McDaniel, Mike Liddle, Blake Axelson, Ryland West, Jon McDonald, Sammy Blazeajewski, Buzz Holbrook, Scotty Vine, Cam Fitzpatrick, Tim Mackenzie, Brent Black and Walt. We would also like to thank Snowboarder Magazine and Seven Springs for hosting yet another Superpark for the books.\nTo boot, we would also like to congratulate Scotty Vine for taking home the Superpark Standout award. In this case, it was not insanely progressive or mind-boggling tricks that earned him the title. Instead, it was his proven ability to ride everything in his path combined with a work ethic that was unmatched at Superpark 19.\nFilm: Sean Black \/ Brent Black\nEdit: Sean Black \/ Nate Shute\nSong: Rose's Pawn Shop \"Country Blues\"\nContributed Footage: Dan Callahan, Murphey, Marcus Rand, Bryan Nero, Sam Duncan, Ashley Dawn Byrd",

            "description": "The Bogart is our smallest and most versatile wheel. It changed Bill's life, and it can change yours. Bill believes in the Bogart so much that he takes to the streets spread the Sucrose gospel, making sure everyone knows the Bogart is the ideal size for your cruiser or city slasher board, and comes equipped with a stoneground finish to slide perfect right out of the packaging. Big round lips keeps the slides smooth, and make sure these wheels roll smoothing on all surfaces. The core offset helps slow you down in slides, and even contributes to grip when you really need to lean into things. If you care about the children, check out the Bogart.\nThe Bogart weighs in at 61mm tall, with a 36mm contact patch and 2.5mm core offset. It comes in 82a in all five colors.\nThe Sucrose Initiative was developed to bring together rider based design, performance across a wide range of conditions, and an effort to start reducing our reliance on petroleum based materials to make these wheels the highest performing and cheapest lift ticket on the hill.\nTo top it off, our exclusive Sugar Formula has a 10% natural Sucrose content which lessens our reliance on petroleum and provides a realistic step in preserving our environment.\nCheck out the whole lineup of Sucrose Initiative wheels at: arborcollective.com\/skateboards\/products\/wheels\/\nRiders: Will Clay, Norman Plante, Cooper Darquea, Daniel Macdonald\nFilm\/Edit: Tom Flinchbaugh",
