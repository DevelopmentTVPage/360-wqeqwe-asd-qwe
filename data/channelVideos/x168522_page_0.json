But even when the laces are torn up and the sole is kickflipped out, it actually looks like a dope shoe.\"\n\nStevie Williams's first signature shoe from SUPRA, the S1W, is a state-of-the-art expression of contemporary footwear fashion and performance. The mid top combines modern design with traditional accents and is rich in advanced technologies. The stylish upper, for instance, is constructed atop an innovative, cored-out cup sole that features a lightweight SUPRAFOAM footbed with impact protection. The molded footbed is thicker in the heel, yet thinner towards the toe for better board feel. The stylish, side-gill design and cushioned ankle pod, which is perforated for breathability, provide extra protection and support. The padded heel-pull insert delivers both functionality and added comfort. \n\n\"Whether you want to wear it just for lifestyle purposes,\" Stevie said, \"or you want to wear it for skateboarding and look cool at the same time\u2014either way you wear it, the shoe looks good on and off the board.\"",

            "description": "In commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the world's premier sneaker culture magazine SUPRA has collaborated with Sneaker Freaker editor, Woody, to create the limited edition \"Blue Balls\" Owen. Woody not only designed this Owen style himself, he wrote the press release for it as well:\n\n\"When we dropped our 'Golden Balls' Skytop III earlier this year,\" Woody wrote, \"we felt a little bit guilty for making it one of those annoying 'friends and family' party releases. With pressure mounting for a rematch, we requested a little relief from the hand of SUPRA. The end result is our super bouncy Blue Balls! This time around we busted a nut on the lightweight Owen, combining brains, brawn, and beauty into one sweet ball breaker of a shoe. SUPRAFOAM shock absorption and a black diamond mesh upper with royal blue microfiber ensures the ride is limo quality, while the rope-a-dope lacing and speckled concrete SUPRAFOAM sole punches harder than Kojak's cojones. Tug on the plush pink heel pull and admire the unorthodox asymmetrical color blocking as you guide your foot deep inside this super snug package. Yep, once you've cupped our throbbing Blue Balls in your hands you simply won't be able to wipe the smile from your dial. Unlike our Golden Balls, these are no wet dream.\"\n\nThe limited edition, Sneaker Freaker tenth anniversary, \"Blue Balls\" Owen is available on Saturday, December 15, at select SUPRA retailers worldwide",

            "description": "SUPRA has created two shoes with new styles designed by Prodigy of Mobb Deep. \n\n\"I don't want to look like everybody else,\" Prodigy said. \"I want people to look at me and wonder what I got on, follow my trend. I like to bring something new to the table and SUPRA goes right along with my whole style.\"\n\nThe \"Infamous\" Backwood is a work boot\/athletic-shoe hybrid constructed atop a unique sole that has a lightweight and comfortable SUPRAFOAM midsole with a rugged, rubber lug outsole. Prodigy designed the upper with grey suede camouflage and black ballistic nylon. \n\n\"Just this whole style of cut reminds me of some throwback stuff from the 90s, but this is an updated version,\" he said about the Backwood. \"I got the inspiration for the color because back in the day when Mobb Deep was coming up in the music industry our thing was to wear a lot of camouflage. A lot of people are getting back into the camo now, so I figure let's flip a color that nobody really uses.\"\n\nThe \"Infamous\" Bandit is the result of Prodigy's take on professional skater, Tom Penny's signature shoe: a boot inspired mid top with a canvas camouflage and black ballistic nylon upper built on a white, lightweight cup sole. \n\n\"This sneaker right here\u2014the Bandit: camouflage, black, with a white bottom\u2014it's simple, you can rock it with basically anything. And the camo just gives it a little hood touch. You could throw a suit on and get away with these right here, you know what I mean?\"",
