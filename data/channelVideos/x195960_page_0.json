Straight-up punk, metal, horror ska, oi and psychobilly are all in the mix and, while the music is diverse, its aggressive approach is a constant. There's always a mosh pit. TV, radio, gossip columns and Internet memes don't support this scene: It must be sought out, specifically, and for a variety of reasons. This is a simple D.I.Y., research- required, no bullshit, anti-establishment, fuck the system, off the wall approach and exactly what kids attending these shows need to feel like they belong. Each character is his or her own person, an individual with their own personal experiences, history, likes and dislikes.
