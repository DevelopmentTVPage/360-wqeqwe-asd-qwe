A local group of twenty somethings revel in the sunshine of summer\u2019s final days. They\u2019re cool, confident and they always know the perfect spots. Everyone wants to know where they are and what they\u2019re thinking, listening to, and wearing. A summer of high shine, seasonless suede, sky high platforms, endless ankle straps, refined sneakers \u2013 everything always denim friendly. From the boardwalk to the beach, they\u2019re at home in the city\u2019s perfect balance of gritty glow.\n\nThey are unapologetic. Effortless. They are Steve Madden personified.\n\n#SM4DAZE",
