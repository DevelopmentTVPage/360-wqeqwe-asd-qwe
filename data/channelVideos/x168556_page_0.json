            "description": "The MT-G watch is a refined, luxury G-SHOCK series crafted at Casio's Yamagata factory in Japan and is meticulously assembled from materials and components made entirely in-house. The timepiece employs G-SHOCK's advanced Core Guard Structure of stainless steel, resin and alpha Gel\u00ae to ensure mechanical integrity, coupled with LED - infused Tough Movement for ongoing precision - The MT-G is the epitome of modern wrist couture.\n\nThe Fall\/Winter 2014 partnership between Todd Snyder and G-SHOCK MT-G consists of both product design and product integration. Using the classic appeal of a gentleman's favorite leather armchair as inspiration - Todd Snyder developed a limited edition watch gift box that bears both the G-SHOCK & Todd Snyder logo. The gift box is constructed out of a black stained wood exterior and dark tan leather interior. The box will house the MTGS1000BD-1A- a version of the G-SHOCK MT-G watch that is finished in refined black Ion Plated stainless steel or the Stainless Steel version of the same model, MTGS1000D-1A. MT-G watches will be seen on the models' wrists as they walk the runway and will also be on display backstage.",

Before landing with his current team, the Brooklyn Nets, the former college stand-out spent the last nine years playing for professional clubs in Italy, Russia, Croatia, Spain and Israel, not to mention several teams in the NBA d-league and the NBA itself (including Toronto, just for good measure). Having spent so much of his life traveling, Alan Anderson knows the value of having your bearings the minute your plane touches down.\n\nAnderson says that, during his first tenure overseas, he was slow to come out of his shell. But as he started to explore his surroundings, he realized that an NBA player abroad has the chance to see the \"best sides of every country, every city.\" When all was said and done, he fell in love with the weather in Israel, the team in Barcelona, and the warm support of the Croatian fans.",
