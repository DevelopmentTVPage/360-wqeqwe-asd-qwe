            "description": "Volcom Peanut Butter Rail Jam blowed up this year in Bia\u0142ka Tatrza\u0144ska on Kotelnica last weekend. The event took place at the snow park and it was bulls eye shot !!! We gathered over a hundred snowboarders form Poland and Slovakia and everyone had a blast ! \nWeather was on our side and helped us to run one of the best snow events in Poland this year !! It was all day sunny and warm, with a fun set up well prepared by the shapers, everything to get people totally hyped to start the jams.\n\nAfter registration we started the main course and jibbers rocked out the spot. Our friends from snow park crew -- Park Pirates built strong street style setup with plenty fun features! Big thanks to them for their great job! Regarding sound supply we need to thanks Red Bull guys for taking care about music and good vibe! Dj was playing all the time electrifying songs and hyping up our audience! Of course we fired up BBQ and served tons of sausage and peanut butter with jam sandwiches.\n\nWe started with the girls division, and with around 20 girls in, the riding level was very high! The beautiful riders made a good mess on the spot , and pushed some nice and mellow tricks on the pyramid and PCV pipes !! Big congrats to our Slovakian friends --Dominika Kralikova, Martina Droppova and Macia Molnarova for taking 3 first place in girls division and shows super technical riding and so solid skills!!\n\nIn the 15 and under the competition was also heavy!! The youngest did some nice tricks on all obstacles. It was tight battle but the best impression and scores gave Marcin Kilar to the top of the podium, Janek Jaromin took the the second place, he is still really small but very talented snowboarder! High five to all young shotguns for the nice show !!\n\nGoing through the day We fired 16 and over division. It was most crowded group that contains almost 40 riders !!! Real madness !! Guys took the competition serious and were ripping bangers all the time with cab to board, nosepresses, lips !! They shredded all obstacles but the most popular one was the Pyramid rail. At the top of podium Lukas Droppa earned his place with smooth and confident style ! Behind him Were Igor Macak and Kacper Gruszka.\nThe day finished with the Open division!!! It was as always the most impressive and solid riding! On a line up we had top of Polish jibbers like Wojtek \"Gniazdo\" Pawlusiak, Mateusz Zielonka, Nikodem Franczak, Maciek D\u0142ugosz and a heavy strong crew of our neighbors from Slovakia !!\n\nThey were bombing every obstacle , ripping the kink with wall ride and Pyramid from every angle. It was a show of perfect rotations, style and flow. Judges didn't have any hesitation with the first place -- it had to be Julo Petrik from Slovakia ! His style was soft and perfect , he probably did the best trick of the event with a 450 lip on a the Pyramid rail.\n\nSecond on the box was Nikodem Franczak , riding so solid and smooth. His technical skills are so dope! Nice job Nixon!!!\n\nThird on the podium stood our Polish Volcom team rider Maciek \"D\u0142ugi\" D\u0142ugosz showing his outstanding jibbing skills and fun making backflips out the rails, Congratulations for Maciek , we are super stoked about his result !!\n\nThere were a lot of prizes for riders including cash money in open and nice goods as well ! It was perfect day full of good snowboarding and chilling time ! We are waiting for PBRJ 2015 !!\n\nAt the and We want to send big thanks to all people who help us in preparations, to Park Pirates for set up, Kotelnica Ski Resort for space, Red Bull crew for music and energy during the event, our partners: Skullcandy, GoPro, GForm, Dakine for extra prizes and official sponsors Nitro and Union Bindings for all goods !\n\nStay in peace and see you next year !!\n\nFINAL RESULTS\n\nCategory OPEN\n1 - JULO PETRIK\n2 - NIKODEM FRANCZAK\n3 - MACIEK D\u0141UGOSZ \n4 - PIOTR TOKARCZYK\n5 - PETER LEDER\n\nCategory 16+\n1 - \u0141UKASZ DROPPA\n2 - IGOR MACAK\n3 - KACPER GRUSZKA\n4 - RAFA\u0141 STYPIE\u0143\n5 - KACPER KILAR\nCategory 15-\n1 - MARCIN KILAR\n2 - JANEK JAROMIN\n3 - MICHA\u0141 TADEL\n4 - KONRAD MIKLASI\u0143SKI\n5 - NATAN KOTOWSKI\n\nCategory GIRLS\n1 - DOMINIKA KRALIKOVA\n2 - MARTINA DROPPOVA\n3 - MACIA MOLNAROVA\n4 - MARCELINA FRYCZ\n5 - ANIA P\u0141OCI\u0143SKA\n\n- Music - \nSong: I'm A Dot In Place\nArtist: The Go\nRelease: Fiesta",

            "description": "Last weekend, the 4th stop of the Volcom PBRJ European Tour went down in Grasgehren, better known as the Railgarden of the Allg\u00e4u. Once again, as it is always the case when Volcom shows up in Grasgehren the weather was not ideal, but during the day it lightened up and Grasgehren was able to present its brighter side!\nTajo Seefried and the Grasgehren shaper crew just lined up an epic set up, both challenging and fun to ride for pros and ams likewise. It basically consisted of a double curved rail that could also be ridden as a flat double rail; an elbow rail which had a separate entry for the downrail and a flat step down rail with entries for the lower part on both sides. It was good to see that besides the local jibbers the PBRJ Grasgehren also catered for a big international crowd. Riders from the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland and Czech Republic found their way to the registration tent, where they were welcomed with sweets, apples, bananas and peanut butter & jam toasts and Tajo's crew served quality burgers that got devoured by the hungry riders.\nDuring the comp, no compromises were made and riders went head over heels on the obstacles, putting all the tricks together you could care to name. In the girls division Momo Dudzinski pulled together the sickest tricks on all three obstacles and landed safe and sound on the first place. Unfortunately she hit her knee on one of the rails and consequently had to pay the local hospital a brief visit. Though, she managed - just in time - to return to the PBRJ to receive tons of goodies and a brand new Union binding. In the 16-21 divison the Austrian representative from Innsbruck Lorenz Vyslozil convinced the judges with his consistency on all three rails and hence got rewarded for his efforts with a brand new Nitro Board and a big ass Volcom bag. The best under 15 rider Nick Wagner (who was riding with the 16-21 division) showed some serious commitment and ripped down the flat down flat rail. In the open division Chris Boehnke convinced the judges with massive 270\u00b0 in 270\u00b0 out combos and some creative riding. At the end of the day Chris walked home with a brand new Nitro board and 250\u20ac more in his pocket, landing on the first place of the open division.\nAfter an half hour discussion the judges announced that the belgian rider Kevin Trammer was found to be \u201eBest Perfomance of the Day\" and therefore is now flying to the PBRJ Global Champs to Mammoth Mountain, USA.\nTo put it in a nutshell, the PBRJ Grasgehren was a blast! Congrats to all the winners and all riders who had as much fun as we had. Many thanks go out to Tajo and his shaper crew who created this massive set up and of course to every helping hand who helped to make this PBRJ a blast. Last but not least a big shout out our sponsors for their support:\nNitro Snowboards (nitrousa.com\/fr), Union Bindings (unionbindingcompany.com) and Monster Energy.\nFull Report, Results & Photos: coming soon\nFoto: Anton Gruslak; Video: Philipp Reinhard\n1.

            "description": "The fog was thick as soup during the Volcom Peanut Butter and Rail Jam in Oslo Vinterpark. \n\nAnders at Oslo Vinterpark did a great job with the setup, which looked amazing and fun to ride, and the riders got quickly excited.\n\nThere was a kinkrail, a regular down rail and a polejam gap to box feature. \nThe 15 and under division did a great job on the gnarly rails, Mr. Sigurd Mygland walked away with the first place and tons of prizes.\n\nThe girls really killed it this year! PBRJ pioneer Dina Treland killed it on all the rails and got first place. The lovely CC Cab really impressed the judges and got 2nd place. Kirsti \u00d8ftsthus took so many gnarly slams (watch the video) that we had to bow our heads in the dust. She got the \"BADASS of the day\" Award.\n\nIn the 16-21 division, we had a lot of gnarly rippers. A lot of crazy tricks went down, we saw a backflip out of the pole jam to 5050 on the box. Christian Bj\u00f8nness was the man of the hour with heavy trick on all the features, he got to the top spot on the podium.\nThe Open category was packed with rippers, there were guys who had driven all the way from Stockholm to join the PBRJ circus. Local Eirik Nesse won everybody's hearts with his super stylish and creative riding. Hugo Wennmyr from Stockholm won the Open category and a great deal of cash. The days overall ripper ended up to be Mr. Eirik Nesse. He will be at the PBRJ World Finals in Mammoth courtesy of Volcom.\nThe crowd was fired up all day and the vibe was amazing. Everybody enjoyed free sodas, hotdogs and amazing snowboarding.\n\nHuge thanks to the guys at Oslo Vinterpark, Electric, Celtek, GoPro, Nitro, Union, Xsories, Coca Cola, Otto Prestmo, \u00d8yvind Heggelund, Kari, Simen, Jonas and Tore Nilsen.\n\nSee ya next year!\n\n\nRESULTS:\n\n15-\n1.
