            "description": "Much like a flock of birds we found ourselves migrating south once again, after the first cold and wet days hit central and northern Europe. Unlike our avian friends, we didn\u2019t get to spend the whole winter in the warmer climate. Ten days had to be enough to do two demos and fill up on sunshine, warmth and good skatespots.\nMalaga was the start and endpoint of our journey. Axel Cruysberghs, Barney Page and Julian Furones met up there with Joan Galceran and Deniz Yilmaz from the Spanish etnies team. On the first day, Axel learned the hard way that you should never leave a backpack with valuable possessions on the backseat of the car. Even if you are skating just around the corner, thieves will know a way to steal your stuff. Finding a Belgian Embassy to get a new passport for Axel became one of the main missions after the weekend.\nFor our next stop we got to spend two days in lovely Chiclana, met up with some old friends and discovered that some of the spots there, had been destroyed, only to be replaced with new and better ones.\nWinter finally caught up with us in Albufeira (Portugal) and we got to spend a rainy day on the beach. The rain didn\u2019t stop us from jumping in the waves and the few people that were about must have figured we were not fully in control of ourselves. When the skies cleared up we discovered some interesting stuff to skate as well as a nice concrete park.\nBirds always find their way home when winter is over and we had to mimic that behavior at the end of the trip, even if the cold season had actually only just started for us.",

The concept behind this freeride phenomenon was to capture the true essence of dirt- bike riding in the hills on natural terrain. This cinematic masterpiece showcases the top riders in the world including Jeremy Stenberg, Nate Adams, Dustin Miller, Mike Mason, Ronnie Renner, Jeremy McGrath, Andy Bakken, Dan Pastor, Todd Potter, Brody Wilson, Daniel Sani, Tyler Beremen, Vinnie Carbone and Myles Richmond.\nTwitch\u2019s 420% All Natural brings you inside the mindset of Jeremy Stenberg and his friends in their search for the ultimate freeride destination. Their journey takes them all across California and Arizona to locations Cameron, Az., Reche Canyon, Beaumont, Ocotillo Wells, Temecula Hills and our new found freeride paradise Morro Bay and Cambria.\n\nWith over 35 minutes of documentary style action-packed content, \u201cTwitch\u2019s 420% All Natural\u201d will make you feel like you are right there riding with the pros. Shot almost entirely on Red Digital, this is the highest quality motocross footage that exists on the planet. With over 7 hours of helicopter time, 5 days of tractor operating and hundreds of hours shoveling in the hills, this film unloads an arsenal of new jumps never seen before.\nPlease join us on this amazing adventure as Twitch and his crew take FMX to an unprecedented level and show what is possible between a man and his machine on natural terrain in \u201cTwitch\u2019s 420% All Natural\u201d.",
