That wave came and I just put my head down. That feeling when they read out the score, it just feels good.\" \n\nHobgood met a different fate in the semis where the 11-time world champ beat him out for a spot in the final showdown. \n\nThe final was on and Slater put on a Cloudbreak clinic against Brazil's Gabriel Medina. Gabriel had impressed the world with his amazing charge to the final but in the end was no match for Kelly's near-perfect performance.\n\n\"That's probably the best I could surf out here,\" Slater said. \"The barrel and the turn sections just lined up for me and I was able to do what I did. That was a perfect canvas for me.\"\n\nWith this win, Slater moves up to 2nd in the ASP World title ratings behind new ratings leader, Mick Fanning.\n\n\nCongratulations Kelly!!\n\n\n- Music - \nSong: \"You Give Me Worms\" (Instrumental)\nArtist: Turbonegro\nRelease: Sexual Harrassment",
