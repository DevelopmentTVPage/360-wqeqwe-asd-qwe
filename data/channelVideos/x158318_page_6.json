Rob Machado and local hero Asher Nolan joined the other Hurley pros to help push the mini groms into waves and also hopped on some boards to showcase their talent for the kids and spectators. As per usual with RMSS events, there were some crazy headstands, the occasional dance move, coffin rides and party waves galore.

There was also a huge crowd on the beach cheering and hooting after each surfer's ride. It was definitely a day to remember. But, the one bummer -- no Snookie sighting.

We've gone all the way from toe-to-ankle high Deerfield Beach, FL to rippable head-high peaks here in Pismo. And if this trend keeps up it looks like we'll be finishing up next week in Oceanside with some grinding double overhead barrels. But don't worry, we're sure the mini groms will still be ready to show up and charge when that happens.
