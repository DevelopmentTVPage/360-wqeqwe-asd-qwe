After all, there's no Nicaragua without \"agua\", and with that mantra in mind Jon Rose and Dane Zaun were able to provide the villages they visited with clean drinking water, while still getting to have a good time. Press play to see how good deeds and good surfing go hand in hand. Also be sure to read on for a letter from Jon Rose about the trip.",

            "description": "The US Open of Surfing is a celebration of not just surf, skate, music and beach culture \u2014 but it's also a time and place to celebrate art. Because it would be silly to deny the relationship our sport has to the art realm. Take a look under most surfer's boards and you'll see some sort of doodle, and then take a look at the US Open of Surfing art wall today and you'll see a hover boarding hamburger. So you see? The two go hand in hand. Because hover boarding is pretty similar to skating (just go with us on this one). So to celebrate that symbiotic relationship, we're bringing a new artist to the art wall every day and letting them have at it with their paint strokes and mad genius. This video takes a look back at the first three days of what is sure to be another great year at the US Open of Surfing. Press play if you're so inclined.",

Their music has the kind of nostalgic feel that immediately puts us in a good mood -- that's why we were happy when they stopped by the studios to perform a few songs.
