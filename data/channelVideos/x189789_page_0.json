White Sands is the largest white gypsum desert in the world and the location of the Trinity Site, where in the mid-40s the US Government detonated the world's first atomic bomb. We've been told it's no longer radioactive.\n\nThe Ezekiel crew was Danny Kurtzman, Ian Hutchison, and Ryan Winship Mark. Joining us on the trip was Photographer: Bryant Eslava (bryanteslava.com), Model: Eric Lodwick (vogueadventure.com), Videographer: Trevor Wineman (trevorwineman.com) and Tess Oakland.\n\nSoundtrack: Limited - New Day Rising",
