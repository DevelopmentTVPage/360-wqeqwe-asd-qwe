            "description": "New and now available, Nixon introduces The Andrew Reynolds Capsule.\n\nWhen the conversation came up about creating a capsule, Andrew was surprised to learn that the slate was clean; he could create and curate anything he wanted for the collection. Drawing inspiration from a 2012 team trip to Argentina, it was during that visit, while buying gifts for friends and family, that Andrew stumbled upon his new favorite belt.\n\nUsing this accessory as the starting point for his capsule, Andrew layered in a wallet, key chain, backpack, beanie, hat, custom belt, watch, a Nixon x Altamont hoodie, and guitar strap to complete the collection. Our friends at Fender got wind of the Boss\u2019 new capsule and wanted to create something special for him as well. The result was a one-of-a-kind telecaster, complete with custom graphics from the Nixon x Andrew Reynolds collection.\n\nInspired by life on the road, his travels, appreciating these experiences and that each new day is a gift, the Nixon x Andrew Reynolds capsule represents the Boss\u2019 daily arsenal. \u201cTo do a collection with Nixon is amazing,\u201d said Andrew. \u201cThis is the stuff I use. When I\u2019m on a trip, this is all I need.\u201d \n\nThe Nixon x Andrew Reynolds Collection is now available in select skate shops, for a limited time only.",
