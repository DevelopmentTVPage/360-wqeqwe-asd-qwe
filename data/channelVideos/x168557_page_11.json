It made a crazy come back last weekend after a couple weeks of bluebird skies in the Alps, not easing things for the 2 Alpes shaper crew to build the Peanut Butter & Rail Jam setup for the french stop. The storm kicked in on the Saturday, and with no visibility at the snowpark, decision has been made to build everything at the bottom of the slopes for the next day event.\n\nOn the Sunday morning, the resort woke up with 30cm of fresh snow, and even if they couldn't use the crazy features they have at the top, the crew did a good job with a basic PBRJ setup fun to ride for everyone, consisting on a down rail, a double kink and a gap to box.\n\nThe storm was hitting us full force during the event but the sun would eventually kick in for some brief moments, but it didn't affect the motivation of all riders that made the trip to take part of this fun day.\nDifferent crew from Vars, Isola, Chartreuse valley, Poland, Estonia, Italy made it to Les 2 Alpes and even a team from Holland drove all the way from Amsterdam, getting stucked in some mountain pass due to a mean GPS (this must have happen to everyone at least once).\n\nNeedless to say, everyone was hyped and rode their best while Smithys tavern was cooking burgers and dogs, check out clips and photos to get an idea, the day was fun.\n\nA few highlights:\n\nLoads of PBRJ regulars showed up such as Tom Picamoles, Remy Trehand or even Joshua Pires and Marten Kikas from abroad.\n\nAnne Sophie Lechon killed it, won the Girls division and was on the line to get the trip to Mammoth for the PBRJ Championships but Joshua Pires made such an impression that the judges had to give him the ticket.\nIt was Boris birthday (owner of the infamous Avalanche Nightclub) that day and his sons rode super good, Arthur Ney winning the 16-21 division while Oscar taking 6th in the 15 and under.\nYoung Italian Ian Matteoli is really small, can do gap fs boardslides, rides a board as long as a skate deck, he took 2nd in the 15 and under.\n\nThere is way more check out the captions to get more...\n\nEveryone went home with a big smile and some prizes thanks to our partners Union Bindings and Nitro Snowboards and the day ended at Smithys for Volcom newest film \"True To This\" premi\u00e8re and loads of refreshments, needless to say that after that the Avalanche was the place to be, making the Monday a perfect hangover day to ride some fresh snow while the sun was back.\n\nThanks to everyone that helped make this contest a success:\nTourism office, Smithys Tavern, Avalanche, Remi and David from Act magazine, Yannick Amevet and the Volcom Store Les 2 Alpes, David Combier, Mathieu Gustobal, Sylvain and the snowpark shaper crew, and Mr Genepi.\n\nResults:\n\nGirls \n1 Anne Sophie Lechon\n2 Celine Glachant\n3 Marjorie Couturier\n4 Helen Meredith (UK)\n5 Natalia Vasquez\n\n16-21 \n1 Arthur Ney\n2 Thomas Delavigerie\n3 Matvey Avkhimovitch\n4 Theo Scafidi\n5 Theo Dupin\n\n15- \n1 Lenny Oliver\n2 Matteoli ian (IT)\n3 Raphael Puygrenier\n4 Eliot Pentecote\n5 Marten Kikas (EST)\n\nOpen \n1 Joshua Pires (NL) 200\u20ac and a trip to the PBRJ Championships \n2 Sam Hadjadj 150\u20ac\n3 Tom Picamoles 100\u20ac\n4 Mel Lamers (NL)\n5 Remi Trehand\n\n- Music - \nSong: Mountaintop Rock\nArtist: Shockwave Riderz\nRelease: Volcom Ent Vinyl Club 0035",
