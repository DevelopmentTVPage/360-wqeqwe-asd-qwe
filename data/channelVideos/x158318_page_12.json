Working with the school colors blue and gold, students were each able to design their own puzzle piece, creating a unified whole from individual parts. Last week saw the project's completion along with a well deserved pizza party and high fives! Video: YB",

You get Jean Noir, a pleasant, LA-based twosome who we lent our music studio to not that long ago. Jean Noir set out with the intent to be neither rock nor alternative, though they haven't lost their edge in the transition, as their EP stands tall in a land of indie white noise. With songs like Sycamore and Graveyard Smash, Jean Noir might just set the soundtrack to your summer. Check out their just-released EP on iTunes and stay tuned for a full length album in the next few months.",

And for the last few weeks we've showcased our personal favorites \u2014 but today we're showing you the video we thought was the best of the best. It's brought to you by Coppell High School and not only does it show off our favorite new tee, the Nfinitee, it's creative, imaginative and an all around fun video to watch.

            "description": "A lack of rideable surf didn't stop our 80 competitors from having the most fun they possibly could have during today's RMSS stop in Deerfield Beach, Florida. And although you wouldn't think it, the flat conditions made for some of the most creative surfing the tour has ever seen -- everything from chair rides, to cartwheels, to 15-second-long headstands. The judges had their had their hands full with all the great action in the water, but in the end it was little Jordan Rosenholtz taking home the win and Jack Koras coming in a close second (side note: for both Jordan and Jack, it was their first time on a surfboard -- very impressive). A big thanks goes out to Cheyne Cottrell and the crew from Island Water Sports for helping us dodge the golf-ball-sized hail during the afternoon slideshow and retail event and also for their huge help in the morning's surf contest.  \n\nVideo: PK",

With the help of Beau Foster, Michael Dunphy, Brian Toth, Mikey DeTemple and Asher Nolan, all the kids were assisted into the best waves they could find and battled it out to see who could have the most fun while riding a surfboard. In the end it was Chase Elmore's mix of progressive moves (he stuck one of the better airs we've seen thus far) and big smiles that earned him the win. For his efforts, Chase took home a new pair of Phantom Create boardshorts, a GoPro camera, Spy sunglasses, Stance Socks, Freestyle gear and Futures Fins -- quite the prize pack.",
