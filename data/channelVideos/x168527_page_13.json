On the most recent etnies endeavor, Willow, Nick Garcia and Julian Davidson took their new signature colorways of the Marana Vulc on a journey into the desert. They embarked in search of skate exploration and put this shoe's blend of strength and style to the test. What they discovered was stark. Slab City is what they found. Armed with power tools, bags of cement mix, and buckets of water, the crew stirred up some skate creation and managed to throw hammers in a desolate location.",

The Pacific Northwest upbringing kindled an affinity for the botanical and entomological. Her hyper-detailed illustrations invoke a surreal understanding of the perfection in nature while capturing the cycle of death coexisting with life and not just decay.\n\"For this collaboration I wanted to integrate life, death and powerful beasts into one story. Each piece has a certain mythos tied to it: The Tiger with the skull connects this strong beast with the strength of man, The Ram skull plays home to serpents and vegetation and the Two Skulls support the connectivity to life and death.\"",
