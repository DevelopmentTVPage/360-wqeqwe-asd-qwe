            "description": "We kicked off the Wild in the Parks tour in glorious form at Volcom's private skatepark on Saturday May 18, 2013.\n\nWilly Wonka opened the candy factory doors to the Wild in the Parks. Never before has the general public had the opportunity to come skate the private skate facility. Competitors from all over California and as far as Oklahoma and Arizona came out to put their skills on display. Special bonus for the tour opener, Volcom Entertainment band Tweak Bird put on a free show for the WITP faithful. It was epic day of skateboarding and a great way to get the tour cracking.\n\nThe 14 & Under division got the party started. This group might be small in stature but their skills are top notch. It's amazing to see the level of talent this California crew possesses. Volcom's own Alex Midler was in attendance and putting on a demo. Even though we only take the single best score in each of the 3 zones, Alex was putting down piles of hammers showing his bag of tricks has some serious depth. His performance earned him the 1st place position but the victory wasn't easy with Oceanside's Cam Sedlick massacring the course. Cam took home the 2nd place title. A road trip from San Jose ended well for Connor Kepp as he took home 3rd place. Good showing to all the young guns that were in attendance.\n\nThe 15 & Over division was next to bat. They were swinging for the fences after witnessing what the 14- crew put down, they knew they needed to step it up. Not holding back Blake Sherwood went on a mission of destruction. Nailing down some serious moves he was awarded top honors for his stellar performance. Nipping at his heals was Oklahoma's Mason Coletti earning the 2nd place position. 3rd was awarded to WITP faithful Tanner Lawler. We are looking forward to seeing how this top 7 stacks up at the $15,000 championship on October 19, 2013.\n\n\n\nThe Open division had the distinction of putting the cap on the day. It was hard to imagine the flames could go any higher but if anyone could burn it down it's this group. Sure enough the finals progressed into a fury of action. Moves were laid down one after another causing pandemonium throughout all in attendance. Rising from the ashes in first place was Chris Gregson earning himself $250, a fat Volcom backpack full of gear, and additional prizes from our sponsors. It was not an easy victory with Dominick Walker not far behind in 2nd place. Christian Sereika held down 3rd place and took home $100 and a grip of gear. Keep on eye on this group come October.\n\n\nIt was a privilege to have a public event at the private park and we are grateful to have had the opportunity. Thanks to all the Volcom family that helped make this a reality and especially all in attendance lending a hand. The support is greatly appreciated. Special thanks to our judging panel: Brian Mack, Harris Hutchinson, and Tyler Mumma for sorting through the madness. Lastly, thank you to our tour sponsors for their contributions.

            "description": "Volcom Peanut Butter & Rail Jam LAAX | 01.02.2014\nThe first stop of the Volcom PBRJ European Tour was hosted by the european mecca of snowboarding, LAAX. This resort is just awesome...location, support and atmosphere have been just great as the previous years and we had a blast there.\nThe LAAX shaper crew built a very creative set-up, fun to ride for all riders from the Pros tot he groms. It consisted of a downrail with a pole jam entry, a Y shaped flat-down rail, and a curved \u201edown tube\". It made for opportunities of all different kind of tricks.\nAt the beginning oft he day the strong south winds were problematic, menacing tents, riders and rails to fly away, but during the day the sun showed up and somehow ist rays shined the wind away. Pretty good move...\nThe contest started at noon, and became immediately serious...from the beginning to the end we saw all kinds of presses, slides and combos you can imagine. It was great to see such a highly motivated bunch of shredders. Even the 15 and under division was killing it with plenty of tricks and the perfect one footed boardslide on the Y rail has to be mentioned here by the youngest competitor!\nSamuel Camenzind Took top honors in this division getting a freee Nitro boards and tons of prizes, while in the 16-21 division Arturs Cukunde took the win getting himself a good Volcom prize bag and a pair of Union bindings.\nIn the girls division, the level was quite impressive but once again Joelle JJ juchli, dominated the pack of good sheboarders friends. Really inspirating to see a Jam of all good friends!\nIn the Open division were the cash prizes got split, Rino Wenger was the most consistent rider and took home 500chf with almost no bails and solid tricks.\nLocal shaper Jeron Lohner, was voted by the judges the most impressive rider of the whole event, killed the set-up with some sick transfer jibs and won the paid trip to compete to the World PBRJ Championships in Mammoth Mountain, in California!!!\nAltogether it was a banger start in LAAX, we`re looking forward to next year. Big thanks to the LAAX shaper crew and resort!\nFurther thanks to everybody who helped to make this event so epic and of course to all our partners",
